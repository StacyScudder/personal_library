Miller has written what critics are calling one of the most powerful accounts of warfare ever published. Here are the horror and heroism of World War II in the words of the men who fought it, the journalists who covered it, and the civilians who were caught in its fury. Miller gives us an up-close, deeply personal view of a war that was more savagely fought - and whose outcome was in greater doubt - than one might imagine. This is the war that Americans on the home front would have read about had they had access to the previously censored testimony of the soldiers on which Miller builds his gripping narrative. </p> <p>Miller covers the entire war - on land, at sea, and in the air - and provides new coverage of the brutal island fighting in the Pacific, the bomber war over Europe, the liberation of the death camps, and the contributions of African Americans and other minorities. He concludes with a suspenseful, never-before-told story of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, based on interviews with the men who flew the mission that ended the war. </p> <p>Donald L. Miller is the John Henry MacCracken Professor of History at Lafayette College.

But the Black Death was arguably the most significant event in Western history, profoundly affecting every aspect of human life, from the economic and social to the political, religious, and cultural. In its wake the plague left a world that was utterly changed, forever altering the traditional structure of European societies and forcing a rethinking of every single system of Western civilization: food production and trade, the church, political institutions, law, art, and more. In large measure, by the profundity of the changes it brought, the Black Death produced the modern world we live in today. </p> <p>While the story of the Black Death is one of destruction and loss, its breathtaking scope and effects make it one of the most compelling and deeply intriguing episodes in human history. Understanding the remarkable unfolding of the plague and its aftermath provides a highly revealing window not only on the medieval world but also on the forces that brought about the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, and modernity itself. </p> <p>Speaking to the full magnitude of this world-changing historical moment, <i>The Black Death: The World's Most Devastating Plague</i>, taught by celebrated medievalist Dorsey Armstrong of Purdue University, takes you on an unforgettable excursion into the time period of the plague, its full human repercussions, and its transformative effects on European civilization. In 24 richly absorbing lectures, you'll follow the path of the epidemic in its complete trajectory across medieval Europe. Majestic in scope and remarkable in detail, this course goes to the heart of one of Western history's most catalytic and galvanizing moments, the effects of which gave us the modern world. </p>","Charlemagne: Father of Europe, The History of Ancient Egypt, Years That Changed History: 1215, The Great Mortality, The Real History of Pirates, Turning Points in Middle Eastern History, The Mongol Empire, Year of Wonders, Renaissance: The Transformation of the West, The Celtic World, A Distant Mirror, The Great Influenza, Great Minds of the Medieval World, King Arthur: History and Legend, The Rise of Rome, World War II: Up Close and Personal, Classical Mythology, The Roman Empire: From Augustus to the Fall of Rome",https://audible.com/pd/B01FWOO4C8?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000440/bk_tcco_000440_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B01FWOO4C8,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61uBSgRDXZL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Dorsey%20Armstrong%20-%20The%20Black%20Death%3A%20The%20World's%20Most%20Devastating%20Plague

As you journey through this largely chronological narrative - occasionally interrupted for lecture-long explorations of specific topics - you'll see key themes emerge, including the assimilation of successive waves of invaders, the tense relationship between kings and the nobility, and the constant battles over money and taxation. And because so much of history is driven by specific individuals and not just historical circumstance, each lecture is rich in intimate portraits that reveal those individuals at the key moments of their historical destiny, including Alfred the Great, William the Conqueror, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and John Wycliffe.The result is a lecture series that winds up being not only informative but deeply entertaining, with each lecture drawing you in with its own particular fascinations, including a probing look at the scope of the Black Death, a realistic examination of the legends of both King Arthur and Robin Hood, a riveting description of the Battle of Bosworth Field, and a discussion of the surprisingly nuanced penalties of the early Germanic law codes. </p> <p>These lectures consistently deliver a fresh level of understanding about medieval England, its rulers and subjects, and their significance for the world we live in today.

Study these crucibles of history to gain a better understanding of why a civilization took - or didn't take - a particular path. Full of dramatic reversals of fortune and colorful characters, this course examines some of the world's most notable examples of military misfortune, from the humiliating destruction of a Roman army at Carrhae in 53 BC to the tragic landings at Gallipoli in World War I. Success and failure, as you'll learn, are two sides of the same coin.</p> <p>These 24 lectures reveal how the trajectory of history hangs in the balance of individual battles; even a single person's actions in a particular moment have made drastic and irreversible impacts. From ancient Greece through global war during the first half of the 20th century, you'll delve into infamous conflicts such as the Charge of the Light Brigade and the Battle of Little Bighorn as well as lesser-known battles.</p> <p>How could an army equipped with cannon be wiped out by Zulu warriors wielding spears and outdated firearms? How could armored French knights be vulnerable to the crude weapons of a band of Flemish shopkeepers? Why would a savvy Chinese general fall victim to a tactic he had previously used himself? Unpredictable twists of fate abound, demonstrating that when it comes to war, there are no givens. Sheer numbers, superior weaponry, and skilled leadership are never a guarantee of success.</p> <p>Take a fascinating journey through some of the most gloriously inglorious wartime encounters. Along the way, you'll get to know some of the most legendary characters in world history.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>","Ancient Civilizations of North America, Great Battles of the Ancient World, American Military History: From Colonials to Counterinsurgents, Warriors, Queens, and Intellectuals: 36 Great Women Before 1400, The Rise of Rome, Why You Are Who You Are, The Roman Empire: From Augustus to the Fall of Rome, An Economic History of the World since 1400, 1776, The Vikings, The Science of Energy, The Great Ideas of Philosophy, 2nd Edition, The Story of Human Language, The Philosopher's Toolkit: How to Be the Most Rational Person in Any Room, How the Earth Works, War and World History, The Pagan World, Crashes and Crises: Lessons from a History of Financial Disasters",https://audible.com/pd/B015983X2O?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000416/bk_tcco_000416_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B015983X2O,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IM5FXB6KL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=The%20Great%20Courses%20-%20History's%20Great%20Military%20Blunders%20and%20the%20Lessons%20They%20Teach

When it became clear that they could not win, all of the fairies moved below ground, except for the 8th Family, the demons. Rather than surrender, they used a magical time spell to take their colony out of time and into Limbo. There they have lived for decades, preparing to exact their violent revenge on humans. <p> Now the time spell is unraveling, and demons are beginning to materialize without warning on Earth. If humans were to find out about them, all fairies would be exposed. To protect themselves, the fairies must predict when the next demon will materialize. But in order to do so, they will have to decipher temporal equations so complicated that even a great brain like Foaly can't understand them.

Despite multiple warnings and portents of dire consequences, Atticus and Leif journey to the Norse plain of Asgard, where they team up with a werewolf, a sorcerer, and an army of frost giants for an epic showdown against vicious Valkyries, angry gods, and the hammer-wielding Thunder Thug himself.</p> <p><b>Don’t miss any of Kevin Hearne’s phenomenal Iron Druid Chronicles novels:</b></p> <p><b>HOUNDED | HEXED | HAMMERED | TRICKED | TRAPPED | HUNTED | SHATTERED | STAKED</b></p>","First Dangle and Other Stories, A Plague of Giants, He Who Fights with Monsters: A LitRPG Adventure, Unsouled, Storm Front, Fated, God Touched, Monster Hunter International, Organ Grind, Strange Days, Shadow Magic, The Hobbit, Max Abaddon and the Will: A Max Abaddon Urban Fantasy Novel, Lycan Fallout, Rosemary and Rue, Off to Be the Wizard, Columbus Day, American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition (A Full Cast Production)",https://audible.com/pd/B0057HS0NK?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/brll/003023/bk_brll_003023_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B0057HS0NK,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pqjM1VI9L._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Kevin%20Hearne%20-%20Hammered

Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister - the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind.&nbsp;</p> <p>All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki - whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.</p>","A Clash of Kings, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Book 1, The Stand, Dune, The Hobbit, Iron, Fire and Ice, Game of Thrones: A Family History, Ready Player One, The Fellowship of the Ring, Blood of Elves, The Way of Kings, Eragon, The Eye of the World, The Dark Tower I, 11-22-63, The Name of the Wind, American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition (A Full Cast Production), The Ice Dragon",https://audible.com/pd/B002UZZ93G?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/000349/bk_rand_000349_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B002UZZ93G,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rDpMtBm5L._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=George%20R.R.%20Martin%20-%20A%20Game%20of%20Thrones

A manhunt ensues - though the authorities aren’t sure if it's a man they should be looking for. </p> <p>Some suspect an escapee from the White Tower, a foreboding biotech facility owned by the Godfrey family, where some suspect that biological experiments of the most unethical kind take place. Others turn to Peter Rumancek, a Gypsy trailer-trash kid who has told impressionable high-school classmates that he’s a werewolf. Or perhaps it’s Roman, the son of the late JR Godfrey, who rules the adolescent social scene with the casual arrogance of a cold-blooded aristocrat, his superior status unquestioned - despite his decidedly freakish sister, Shelley, whose monstrous medical conditions belie a sweet intelligence, and his otherworldly, sexy control-freak of a mother, Olivia. </p> <p>As the crime goes unsolved and the police seem more and more willing to believe any outlandish rumor, Peter and Roman decide the only way to save their own skins is to find the killer themselves. Along the way they uncover local secrets and designs that are much bigger than some small-town murder. </p> <p><i>Hemlock Grove</i>&nbsp;is an exhilarating reinvention of the gothic novel, inspired by the iconic characters of our greatest myths and nightmares.
