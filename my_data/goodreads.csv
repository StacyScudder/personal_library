The first book is dark, but this one comes in a kaleidoscope of the shades of night. There are sci-fi (and sci-fact!) elements mixed together with dystopian fantasy and mythology. It's a mix that not many authors could pull off, but Sullivan makes it seem easy. There are nymphs, vampires, and saints along with the Mandelbrot set,  space travel, and black holes all blended together into a thought-provoking book that touches on topics relevant to us all. <br/><br/>This book, like the first, isn't a fluff book, so if you're looking for something to read that will let you concentrate on other things, don't bother cracking the spine. If, however, you want something dark and deep, then you've come to the right place.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The first, The Lightning Stenographer, was much deeper and harder to follow than this one, but worth the effort. This story didn't throw me around as much, and even though it was more violent, didn't feel as dark to me. Of course, dark is a plus as far as I'm concerned, so bear that in mind.<br/><br/>The Heirophant's Daughter takes place in an alternate future and comes complete with a timeline that I didn't notice until I read some of the other reviews. It cleared up quite a few of the gaps in my reading, although I didn't get too confused without it. You do have to carry on reading to understand some of it, but I like to turn those gaps over in my mind to come up with plausible possibilities. When they're explained later (and they are in this book), it just makes all those imaginings even better when they're close to the author's path. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a fun, fluffy read, step away from this book. If you're looking for a new twist on vampires and don't mind putting a little thought into the story, then I highly recommend this one. I'm looking forward to seeing where the next book goes!<br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Reading the third book first, I didn't feel like I was missing anything. There were small things about the relationship that will probably be clearer when I finish the first book, but I didn't feel lost like can happen with other series. <br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the next book to see what happens with Victoria and Stoker. Victoria, with all her intelligence and self-confidence, seems to me to be much more vulnerable than her outward appearance would show. Stoker, however, is my favorite. The encounters with his past in this book showed what a complex character he is. <br/><br/>There were parts of the mystery that I guessed would happen, but there was plenty I didn't see coming. I knew the main villain was the culprit fairly early, but I was wrong about one of the others who turned out to be completely innocent. Overall, it was an entertaining read.",,,2,,,0,,,,,

There's romance, adventure, but most of all there's humor. It was such a fun read.<br/><br/>The second story, Fake Mated to the Wolf, by Milly Taiden was also similar to her other stories. I think the characters are from another series, but it's not one I've read before. Even so, it was a stand-alone and doesn't depend on reading previous books. It was a fun read, but the name of the main character annoyed me to no end. <br/><br/>The third story, The Witch, the Werewolf, and the Waitress, by Kate Baxter had some new twists that I haven't read before (and I've read LOTS of these stories).

I really expected it to be more offensive than it was. Yes, there are some things that made me wonder why she said it. For example, calling Amythest Schaber a ""manic pixie dream girl."" There really was no reason to describe anyone like that...ever! Maybe she didn't mean it in the same sense that Nathan Rabin did, but someone should have caught it before it went to print. <br/><br/>The part about imagining Gus having sex was just creepy. I mean, who wants to imagine their kids (or parents, grandparents, etc.) having sex? Maybe it was meant to be humorous since she compared to Benny Hill and Yakkety Sax. I have no idea what was going on in her head when writing this, but I have to say that, as a parent, it kind of skeeved me out.<br/><br/>From what I understand, the biggest complaint about the book is the author taking about getting medical power of attorney so she can make sure Gus has a vasectomy. This one stumped me. I was furious that she even thought about doing this! After reading more, I'm not so sure what to think. Yes, this reminded me of the whole eugenics movement and literally made me nauseous to read it and think some parent considered this for her child. Later she makes it sound like she'd only do it as a temporary measure (most vasectomies can be reversible these days) to let Gus mature to the point he's ready to be a father. Whether she meant it to be temporary or permanent doesn't really make up for the fact that she considered it. <br/><br/>I can imagine being on the spectrum and reading this book how infuriated I'd be. Autistic people are people, with feelings, hopes, and dreams just like anyone else. Yes, they may see the world in a completely different light than other people, but even so-called neurotypical people can see the world in drastically different ways than other neurotypicals. <br/><br/>This book was written from the point-of-view of a mother, who admits she wasn't even sure she wanted children and ended up with twins. Most parents with autistic children struggle to make sure their child can manage when they're on their own. Hell, most parents struggle with the same thing, no matter how capable their children seem. I'm not particularly happy with some of the ideas the author had, but people should also realize that these are her thoughts and feelings. We all have some of those we act on and others we know won't go further than our heads. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I'm a college math instructor and many of my students seem to have the problems of the world on their shoulders. I know that's what all 18 and 19 year-olds think, but that's just their limited view of life. The students I'm talking about are the ones who miss class because their drug-addicted parents kick them out of the house and they either oversleep because they had to sell their phone and watch or they're embarrassed because they only have one outfit to wear and it smells. Even those students have a better deal than the ones in this book. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the book, it's uplifting to see how Ms. Kuo's attention makes such a difference to all the students. They bloom in her class because they finally have someone who cares. I see that happen occasionally in my own classes and it keeps me from being overwhelmed by frustration at not being able to help all my students. <br/><br/>The part that got me was what happens to those same students when she leaves. Maybe all teachers want to believe that they make a difference in someone's life. I know I'm that idealistic and I can't be the only one. The reality is, however, that once they're out of our classroom, they're faced with all the same problems. Sometimes caring just isn't enough. <br/><br/>This book has stayed with me for weeks. On a recent conference trip, I even made a side trip to Helena, Arkansas because I wanted to see where the book takes place. I'm really not even sure why I thought it was important, and after driving around the streets, I'm still not sure. I think I was looking for a way to say that Helena isn't like the towns around mine. If it's smaller, or poorer, or just worse in some way, then my kids would have a better chance - the bloom will stick for some of them.<br/><br/>If you work with kids, read this book. It will change you. It made me realize that I may never be able to change a student's life as dramatically as I'd like. But maybe...just maybe, I can help them see that they can change it themselves. In the end, however, the most important changes will be the ones those students make on my own life.",true,,1,,,0,,,,,

I know they're not everyone's cup of tea, but I'm sort of ambivalent. This one doesn't seem necessary for the series, but I loved Caspion and Mirceo in the earlier books and wanted to see them get their own HEA. I've always loved Kresley Cole's stories and this one didn't disappoint. There were times I wanted to strangle both the main characters, but books that can make me feel that way towards ANY character are well worth the read. <br/><br/>I'm not sure why people are giving this book a low rating while admitting that they'd never read it. To me, that seems to insult other readers' intelligence. It's right there in the blurb that this book has two males falling in love. Do they think people will read the synopsis and, being undecided, read their rant about how m/m books are gross to decide not to read it? Really? Rating a book without reading it is just childish and not a good look for anyone. Read it or don't, you're not special enough that other people's reading choices are hanging on your every word.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It may not appeal to a historian or someone who has studied the Revolution in detail, but then again, it might. I can honestly say that it's not written on a level that would go over anyone's head.

Many self-published books have too many errors for me to get through the entire book, no matter how good the story could be. This book, thankfully, wasn't like that. The timing was great, the characters were extremely well-developed, and the storytelling was amazing. Even though I could see glimmers of what might happen at the end, it still surprised me. You knew the ending was going to contain certain elements, but trying to see how those elements would come together was what kept me reading all night. All in all, this was an excellent book and I recommend it to anyone interested in thinking about what direction our technology is going to take and how that's going to affect what is is that makes us human.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Owl didn't really do it for me like a heroine should. She was a bit two-dimensional, while some of the other characters (Oricho and Nadya) stood out. <br/><br/>It didn't help that in the first chapter she says that she took a Japanese artifact out from under a team of archaeologists working on the Terracotta Warrior site. Why did that bother me? The Terracotta warriors are CHINESE! What's an artifact from Japan doing in China? Since it was never explained and Owl said it like it was nothing, I'm going to assume that the author didn't do any research at all before throwing that in. <br/><br/>I also have a hard time reading about someone who takes artifacts from their sites for profit. Maybe it's because I have an anthropology background, but I had to keep reminding myself that it was just a book. Still, I can't read/watch Curious George to this day and my kids and grandkids don't watch it either. <br/><br/>That said, I'm still going to listen to the second book. It's mostly because I'm curious about Carpe and I want to see if Oricho pops back up. <br/> ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The narrator was good, but the story itself could have been much better. Sydney's actions and reactions were totally unbelievable and Kade's character just seemed flat. And could someone please take the thesaurus away from the author? I mean, she has the female lead 'calcitrate' her legs. Without context or a dictionary, how many people know what that is? Just say she kicked for goodness sake! Of course, there was also my favorite - Sydney descended her arm. She meant that Sydney lowered her arm, but what she said is that Sydney climbed down her own arm. I have a great imagination, but even I have trouble picturing anyone but a contortionist pulling that one off. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The writing, however, ruined it for me and I found it hard to finish reading it. There were just so many weird wordings and editing mistakes that took too much away from what could have been an excellent novella. For example, after the main couple's first time together, Abigail ""sighed over and over."" That sounds, at least to me, like she was more disappointed than content. After Gerrod had been taken by the Invictus, Gus comes to tell Abigail what's happened. Keep in mind that Gus seems to adore Gerrod and would understandably be upset about him being in enemy hands. Yet, he only gives a 'recital' to explain everything to Abigail like he isn't really feeling anything at all.<br/>The world-building was a bit thin, but that can be overlooked for a novella in a series. I may give the second book in the series a try to see if the writing/editing improves. Especially since I've heard and read such good things about Caris Roane's books.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This one was just boring. I started it several times and had to make myself finish it. Most of the story was Maria talking about her undying devotion to Dante, even if he just happened to be killing people while in his animal form. I have to say that I think Ellen's character was much easier to like than Maria and Will seemed more interesting than Dante. Reading more about Will would be the only reason I read the second book in the series. I'll definitely try more of Sharon Shinn's books, however, since one of her other series is a favorite.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This book builds beautifully on the first three and brings more in for future stories. <br/><br/>The ending was the perfect lead in to the next story and I can't wait to read it!

I've just never warmed up to him as a character; he always seems a bit flat to me. With this book, I can see that Eric and Sookie aren't meant to be and I'm really curious what's going to happen after this ending has her saving Sam instead of wishing for Eric to stay with her. <br/><br/>The story in this book was excellent as well. There were plenty of twists and turns and I didn't expect some of them at all. This was one of my favorite books in this series and I'm simultaneously looking forward to and dreading the last book.

It's a nice mix of old and new and the mystery kept me guessing whodunit. Well, some of the mystery is obvious, but you don't see the whole picture until the ending, which is how it should be.

I have to say that the narrator, who would have been great if none of the characters needed accents, had a really nice voice and did an excellent job. He used distinct voices for the characters, but I cringed when he did Ricky's Irish accent. He didn't do any accent at all for Amaury, which was a real disappointment.

Sometimes you just have to do something you didn't think you ever could to protect humanity. <br/><br/>The feel for this book is starting to remind me of Kim Harrison's Rachel Morgan series.

Hanover has come up with a new take on the paranormal creature scene. We still have vampires and werewolves along with lots of other categories of beasties, but they're separate entities, called riders by the main characters, who inhabit humans. I really enjoyed the book - enough to go buy the rest of the series, but it didn't jump to the top of my favorite series list. Of course, I tend to prefer more humor. Another thing that bothered me was the almost non-existent sex scene. It reminded me of an old movie where there's enough innuendo to know what's going on, but no steam. I'm not one to insist on graphic sex, but something a bit less bland than 'we went through two condoms' please. I'm not sure if that's exactly what was said, but you get the general idea.<br/><br/>The characters are very interesting and have as much development as most in the first book of a series. You get an idea of where they all are coming from (except for Ex), and what makes them tick. I can't say anything about editing since I listened to the audio book and I don't catch mistakes through my ears unless they're glaringly obvious.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys PNR or UF.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
