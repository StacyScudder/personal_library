In many cases their survival was miraculous, if puzzling. Observers were amazed by the transformations that took place when different parts of the brain were destroyed, altering victims' personalities. Parents suddenly couldn't recognize their own children. Pillars of the community became pathological liars. Some people couldn't speak but could still sing. </p> <p>In <i>The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons</i>, Sam Kean travels through time with stories of neurological curiosities: Phantom limbs, Siamese twin brains, viruses that eat patients' memories, blind people who see through their tongues. He weaves these narratives together to create a story of discovery that reaches back to the 1500s and the high-profile jousting accident that inspired this book's title.* With the lucid, masterful explanations and razor-sharp wit his fans have come to expect, Kean explores the brain's secret passageways and recounts the forgotten tales of the ordinary people whose struggles, resilience, and deep humanity made neuroscience possible. </p> <p>*""The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons"" refers to the case of French king Henri II, who in 1559 was lanced through the skull during a joust, resulting in one of the most significant cases in neuroscience history.

This practice offers families the freedom to allow their child to shop and work - and in some cases, it saves them from the disgrace of not having a male heir. But in adolescence, religion restores the natural law. The girls must marry, give birth, and give up their freedom. </p><p>Ukmina decided to confront social and family pressure and keep her menswear. This brave choice paved the way for an extraordinary destiny: She wages war against the Soviets, assists the mujaheddin and ultimately commands the respect of all whom she encounters. She eventually becomes one of the elected council members of her province. But freedom always has a price. For ""Ukmina warrior"" that price was her life as a woman. </p><p>This is a stunning and brave memoir about a little known practice that will challenge your perceptions about gender and the courage it takes to live your life to the fullest.</p>","We Are Afghan Women, James Allen - Complete Premium Collection, The Mushroom Medicine Cabinet, The Nine Lives of Pakistan, In the Land of Invisible Women, In Order to Live, The Murmur of Bees, I Am Malala, The Favored Daughter, Infidel, Led by Faith, Wild Swans, Keeping Hope Alive, Growing Up bin Laden, The Business Book, When Heaven and Earth Changed Places, The Law Book, An American Bride in Kabul",https://audible.com/pd/B00N3Y9P9C?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/020074/bk_adbl_020074_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00N3Y9P9C,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51h2QE+kSvL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Ukmina%20Manoori%20-%20I%20Am%20a%20Bacha%20Posh

Turing's openness about his homosexuality at a time when it was an imprisonable offense ultimately led to his untimely death at the age of only 41. </p> <p>In <i>Alan Turing: Unlocking the Enigma</i>, David Boyle reveals the mysteries behind the man and his remarkable career. Aged just 22, Turing was elected a fellow at King's College, Cambridge on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem. By the age of 33, he had been awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services: Turing was instrumental in cracking the Nazi Enigma machines at the top secret code breaking establishment at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. </p> <p>But his achievements were to be tragically overshadowed by the paranoia of the post-War years. Hounded for his supposedly subversive views and for his sexuality, Turing was prosecuted in 1952, and forced to accept the humiliation of hormone treatment to avoid a prison sentence. Just two years later, at the age of 41 he was dead. The verdict: cyanide poisoning. </p> <p>Was Turing's death accidental as his mother always claimed?

This is <i>Bluebird Memories</i>, part of Audible's Words + Music that blends storytelling, music, and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience.</p> <p>Written and conceived by Common with Awoye Timpo and NSangou Njikam, originally recorded live at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York City, and backed by a world-class band including special guest appearance by Robert Glasper and an ensemble of vocalists, <i>Bluebird Memories</i> tracks Common’s intimate journey from childhood to manhood. At its heart, it serves as both an open letter to his estranged father and a personal meditation on the quest for greater self-understanding, self-worth, and connection to the world that surrounds him.</p> <p>As a young artist, introduced to the work of literary icons from James Baldwin and Gwendolyn Brooks to Rakim and Melle Mel, Common would grow to use their works as motivation and a high-water mark for what would become his life in words. In a performance that recounts stories about growing up in Chicago, discovering hip-hop, longing for a consistent father, and his awakening into Black consciousness, the evolution of Common, as son, as man, artist, and activist, is all here - unpacked and laid bare.</p> <p>At just under two hours, <i>Bluebird Memories</i> is constantly in motion, soaring with emotion and pulsing with raw vitality. Seamlessly blending, stretching, and playing with forms, Common slides between poetry and candid conversation, kicks into one of his classic tracks, and backs out into a moment of nearly silent reflection. For those hip-hop heads, the treat of hearing Common bounce between bars of his own self-admitted cringey party raps to rapturously reciting classic hip-hop’s most revered verses is a joy to behold. (Yes, bumping human beatbox included.) In a performance that calls forth the spirit and legacy of so many artists, thinkers, and heroes who informed both his artistry and personal philosophy, Common invites listeners to experience him in his totality. A finely tuned instrument capable of conveying a sweeping breadth of power, range, and tone. Listen to a modern icon deliver at the top of his craft.</p>","Let Love Have the Last Word, More Myself, Greenlights, Open Book, Broken Horses, Me, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, My Mum's a Twat, The Mother of Black Hollywood, Born to Run, A Song for You, Dolly Parton, Songteller, Acid for the Children, The Baddest Bitch in the Room, It's a Long Story, Never Broken, Let's Go (So We Can Get Back), My Voice",https://audible.com/pd/B08DG7X16V?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000939/or_orig_000939_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B08DG7X16V,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516mu-GabiL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Common%20-%20Bluebird%20Memories

Paradoxically characterized as both barbaric and innocent, the Celts appeal to the modern world as a symbol of a bygone era, a world destroyed by the ambition of empire and the spread of Christianity throughout Western Europe. Despite the pervasive cultural and literary influence of the Celts, shockingly little is known of their way of life and beliefs, because very few records of their stories exist. In this book, for the first time, Philip Freeman brings together the best stories of Celtic mythology. </p> <p>Everyone today knows about the gods and heroes of the ancient Greeks, such as Zeus, Hera, and Hercules, but how many people have heard of the Gaulish god Lugus or the magical Welsh queen Rhiannon or the great Irish warrior Cú Chulainn? We still thrill to the story of the Trojan War, but the epic battles of the Irish Táin Bó Cuailgne are known only to a few. And yet those who have read the stories of Celtic myth and legend - among them writers like J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis - have been deeply moved and influenced by these amazing tales, for there is nothing in the world quite like them. In these stories a mysterious and invisible realm of gods and spirits exists alongside and sometimes crosses over into our own human world; fierce women warriors battle with kings and heroes, and even the rules of time and space can be suspended. Captured in vivid prose these shadowy figures - gods, goddesses, and heroes - come to life for the modern listener. </p>","Mythology: Mega Collection, Mythos, Wild Magic, The Children of Odin, Celtic Mythology: A Compelling Path Retracing Celtic Mythology, Greek Mythology, Celtic Mythology: Fascinating Myths and Legends of Gods, Goddesses, Heroes and Monster from the Ancient Irish, Welsh, Scottish and Brittany Mythology, Poems of the Elder Edda, Botanical Folk Tales of Britain and Ireland, The Silmarillion, Greek Mythology, The Scottish Fairy Book, Norse Mythology: Tales of Norse Myth, Gods, Goddesses, Giants, Rituals & Viking Beliefs, The Morrigan, Mythology, D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths, The Pillars of the Earth, Norse Mythology",https://audible.com/pd/B076TC9ZQV?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/brll/009605/bk_brll_009605_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B076TC9ZQV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515rYqmg0qL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Philip%20Freeman%20-%20Celtic%20Mythology

At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (<i>It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split</i>) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman</i> originally re-defined the graphic novel.&nbsp;</p> <p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three “tools” that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more.&nbsp;</p> <p>A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan.

Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before it’s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom. But Nana Mora is convinced it's real.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, Nana and Eliza pack up their gear and set out on their journey. As they travel, Eliza hears the real story of Sirens Harbor...along with the story of a fearsome mermaid named Silverswift, a warrior-princess rumored to have walked on the islands. Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them. It's almost as if some things are meant to stay secret. As if the harbor doesn't want to be found. Or as if, maybe, someone doesn't want them to find it....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>One thing is for sure: what Eliza and her grandmother actually discover on the night of the winter solstice will be better than any fairytale. As Nana Mora says: ""Some stories aren't fiction, my darling Eliza. Some stories are lifetimes.""&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","The Chronicles of Narnia Adult Box Set, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Book 1, Where the Crawdads Sing, The Mystwick School of Musicraft, Wishes and Wellingtons, City of Girls, Anne of Green Gables, A Wrinkle in Time, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, Never Have I Ever, My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry, The Girl Who Drank the Moon, Where the Forest Meets the Stars, The Ten Thousand Doors of January, When We Believed in Mermaids, What the Wind Knows, A Fire Sparkling, Once Upon a River",https://audible.com/pd/B08B46CK1J?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000943/or_orig_000943_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B08B46CK1J,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vNU48y7OL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Natalie%20Lloyd%20-%20Silverswift

Two of the houses are habitable, while the third is slowly and mysteriously being buried beneath an enormous dune of blindingly white sand. But though long uninhabited, the third house is not empty. Inside, something deadly lies in wait. Something that has terrified Dauphin Savage and Luker McCray since they were boys and which still haunts their nightmares.

Each time, civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon King's hordes, but humanity has remained secure in the belief that a Hero of legend will always save them. There's just one slight problem. It's only been 23 years since the Demon King's latest rise, and this time, he's already conquered more than half the world. If humanity simply waits for the Hero's return, there may be no world left for him to save.</p> <p>And so, Yui Shaw sets out with an ambitious plan. A 10-step plan.</p> <p>She'll find a way to obtain the Hero's legendary sword. She'll earn obscure classes, gain levels, and increase her skills. She'll travel to the meticulously-crafted dungeons that seem designed for one specific Hero to complete. And, if she's truly (un)fortunate, she might even find a fairy.</p> <p>She might not be a Hero - but if she can fake it long enough, she might still be able to save the world.</p>","He Who Fights with Monsters: A LitRPG Adventure, Six Sacred Swords, Forging Divinity, Unsouled, Sufficiently Advanced Magic, The Final Empire, Project Hail Mary, The Eye of the World, Skyward, The Land: Founding: A LitRPG Saga, The False Hero, Volume 1, Defiance of the Fall 3, Godkiller Mode, Lord January, Dungeon Crawler Carl, Ready Player One, The Way of Kings, The Perfect Run",https://audible.com/pd/B086R2N27Y?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000764/or_orig_000764_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B086R2N27Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZyKoD7MLL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Andrew%20Rowe%20-%20How%20to%20Defeat%20a%20Demon%20King%20in%20Ten%20Easy%20Steps

Himself 10 years sober, Shubaly addresses the slippery nature of alcoholism, and the messy, anxiety-ridden process of making the decision to stop drinking once and for all.&nbsp;</p> <p>For Shubaly, there is no one-size-fits-all plan. He refutes the notion that the one and only solution for those struggling are 12-step programs and provides a guide for those who want a different approach to getting sober. This is a how-to for those who are serious about taking their lives back, but are ready to define their sobriety on their own terms.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the process, Shubaly exposes - in brutal, up-close, and yes, even absurd and funny detail - what drove him to drink, how he put the bottle down, and the surprising life that awaited him when he did. <i>Cold Turkey</i> real, practical, and intimate advice for those struggling, straight from someone who has really been there. Sure, he understands that for the first three days, you might need to eat all the pizza and all the greasy Chinese food. But he also understands the urgent need to improve your life and habits little by little, day by day. Shubaly, no doubt, becomes the listener’s cheerleader. He wants anyone struggling to succeed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ultimately, the takeaway is very simple; if Shubaly did it, you can too. And more than that, he’ll be right there with you every step of the way.</p>","Alcohol Explained, This Naked Mind, How to Quit Drinking, Recovery, Zombies! Zombies!

In <i>The Witches Are Coming</i>, firebrand author of the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling memoir and now critically acclaimed Hulu TV series <i>Shrill </i>Lindy West turns that refrain on its head. You think this is a witch hunt? Fine. You've got one.</p> <p>In a laugh-out-loud, incisive cultural critique, West extolls the world-changing magic of truth, urging listeners to reckon with dark lies in the heart of the American mythos, and unpacking the complicated, and sometimes tragic, politics of not being a white man in the 21st century. She tracks the misogyny and propaganda hidden (or not so hidden) in the media she and her peers devoured growing up, a buffet of distortions, delusions, prejudice, and outright bullsh*t that has allowed white male mediocrity to maintain a death grip on American culture and politics-and that delivered us to this precarious, disorienting moment in history.</p> <p>West writes, ""We were just a hair's breadth from electing America's first female president to succeed America's first black president. We weren't done, but we were doing it. And then, true to form-like the Balrog's whip catching Gandalf by his little gray bootie, like the husband in a Lifetime movie hissing, 'If I can't have you, no one can' - white American voters shoved an incompetent, racist con man into the White House.""</p> <p>We cannot understand how we got here - how the land of the free became Trump's America - without examining the chasm between who we are and who we think we are, without fact-checking the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and each other.

Her father is dead, her fiancé took her inheritance, and no one will employ her, despite years working for her watchmaker father. Indeed, the other London watchmakers seem frightened of her. Alone, poor, and at the end of her tether, India takes employment with the only person who'll accept her - an enigmatic and mysterious man from America, a man who possesses a strange watch that rejuvenates him when he's ill. Matthew Glass must find a particular watchmaker, but he won't tell India why any old one won't do. Nor will he tell her what he does back home, and how he can afford to stay in a house in one of London's best streets. So when she reads about an American outlaw known as the Dark Rider arriving in England, she suspects Mr. Glass is the fugitive. When danger comes to their door, she's certain of it. But if she notifies the authorities, she'll find herself unemployed and homeless again - and she will have betrayed the man who saved her life. With a cast of quirky characters, an intriguing mystery, and a dash of romance, <i>The Watchmaker's Daughter</i> is the start of a thrilling new historical fantasy series from the author of the best-selling <i>Ministry of Curiosities</i>, <i>Freak House</i>, and the Emily Chambers Spirit Medium books. </p>","Murder at the Mayfair Hotel, The Last Necromancer, Elementals: The Complete Series, Spinning Silver, Schooled in Magic, Black Hills, The Hazel Wood, The Palace of Lost Memories, Forging Hephaestus, The Spymaster's Lady, Mistletoe and Mireworth, The Medium, The Chemist, War and Peace, Six of Crows, A Court of Thorns and Roses, Manners and Monsters Collection, Orphan X",https://audible.com/pd/B01NCNAQN1?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/acx0/075736/bk_acx0_075736_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B01NCNAQN1,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HAAWlApwL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=C.%20J.%20Archer%20-%20The%20Watchmaker's%20Daughter

With an original voice that combines fearless curiosity and mordant wit, Caitlin tells an unusual coming-of-age story full of bizarre encounters, gallows humor, and vivid characters (both living and very dead). Describing how she swept ashes from the machines (and sometimes onto her clothes), and cared for bodies of all shapes and sizes, Caitlin becomes an intrepid explorer in the world of the deceased. Her eye-opening memoir shows how our fear of dying warps our culture and society, and she calls for better ways of dealing with death (and our dead). In the spirit of her popular Web series, ""Ask a Mortician"", Caitlin’s engaging narrative style makes this otherwise scary topic both approachable and profound. </p> <p>Caitlin Doughty, the host and creator of the ""Ask a Mortician"" Web series and the collective Order of the Good Death, is on a mission to change the way we think about death.</p>","Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?, Stiff, All That Remains, Confessions of a Funeral Director, Working Stiff, Dark Archives, Tuesdays with Morrie, The Man Who Wasn't There, The Radium Girls, Dolly Parton, Songteller, Atomic Accidents, Crash Test Girl, Troublemaker, The Harvard Psychedelic Club, Me Before You, The Fault in Our Stars, Many Lives, Many Masters, The Chick and the Dead",https://audible.com/pd/B00NP724GS?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/008090/bk_reco_008090_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00NP724GS,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51A29+YJDRL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Caitlin%20Doughty%20-%20Smoke%20Gets%20in%20Your%20Eyes

Through decades of music by one of the best-selling musicians of all time, who created classics like ""Fire and Rain"" and ""Carolina in My Mind"", James Taylor has doled out his history in the poetry of his work. Taylor says his early life is, ""the source of many of my songs"", and <i>Break Shot</i> is a tour of his first 21 years in rich, new detail. Praised by Forbes magazine as going ""beyond the spoken word"", <i>Break Shot </i>combines storytelling, music and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience. Longtime fans will savor a crop of musical gems, including an unreleased recording of the beloved hymn ""Jerusalem"", selections from his newest release <i>American Standard</i>, as well as new original scoring by Taylor specially recorded for <i>Break Shot</i> and more from the Grammy Award-winning artist.</p> <p>Recorded in his home studio, The Barn in western Massachusetts, Taylor tells the deeply personal story of his youth, which is entwined with the story of his family. What started as an idyllic tight unit soon became a family sent to different emotional corners - like a break shot in the game of pool, he says, when you slam the cue ball into the fifteen other balls and they all go flying off. By the time Taylor released his breakout second album in 1970, <i>Sweet Baby James</i>, he had seen the disintegration of his parents’ marriage and his family crumble in the aftermath. He had committed himself twice to a psychiatric hospital, battled depression, a heroin addiction, suffered a relapse, and traveled far away from the wood smoke and moonshine of the North Carolina landscapes in which he came of age. Despite it all, he was also on the cusp of super-stardom and on his way to bringing light and joy to millions. He was 21.</p> <p>Journey with James Taylor to a time before he became a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors and both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Arts - and a beloved voice to millions.</p>","Patti Smith at the Minetta Lane, Miracle and Wonder, Greenlights, A Natural Woman, Fire and Rain, A Promised Land, Boys in the Trees, In Pieces, Me, Open Book, Born to Run, Sherlock Holmes, Broken Horses, How to Train Your Mind, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, A Game of Thrones, Dolly Parton, Songteller, Begin Again",https://audible.com/pd/B081D9H5J3?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000937/or_orig_000937_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B081D9H5J3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41g1nLoWLiL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=James%20Taylor%20-%20Break%20Shot%3A%20My%20First%2021%20Years

In this controversial and exciting listen, Pollan explores caffeine’s power as the most-used drug in the world - and the only one we give to children (in soda pop) as a treat.</p> <p>Pollan takes us on a journey through the history of the drug, which was first discovered in a small part of East Africa and within a century became an addiction affecting most of the human species. Caffeine, it turns out, has changed the course of human history - won and lost wars, changed politics, dominated economies. What’s more, the author shows that the Industrial Revolution would have been impossible without it. The science of how the drug has evolved to addict us is no less fascinating. And caffeine has done all these things while hiding in plain sight! Percolated with Michael Pollan’s unique ability to entertain, inform, and perform, <i>Caffeine </i>is essential listening in a world where an estimated two billion cups of coffee are consumed every day.</p>","This Is Your Mind on Plants, How to Change Your Mind, Why We Sleep, The Omnivore's Dilemma, The Art of War, Food Rules, A Promised Land, Second Nature, What If?, A Place of My Own, The Compound Effect, In Defense of Food, The Body, The Botany of Desire, The Power of Habit, The Craving Mind, The 5AM Club, How to Decrease Burnout and Increase Joy",https://audible.com/pd/B083MVZ91Y?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000681/or_orig_000681_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B083MVZ91Y,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41QNn+uS3mL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Michael%20Pollan%20-%20Caffeine

While modern social life can make even the best of us feel gawky, for roughly one in five of us, navigating its challenges is consistently overwhelming - an ongoing maze without an exit. Often unable to grasp social cues or master the skills and grace necessary for smooth interaction, we feel out of sync with those around us. Though individuals may recognize their awkward disposition, they rarely understand why they are like this - which makes it hard for them to know how to adjust their behavior. </p> <p>Psychologist and interpersonal relationship expert Ty Tashiro knows what it's like to be awkward. Growing up, he could do math in his head and memorize the earned run averages of every National League starting pitcher. But he couldn't pour liquids without spilling and habitually forgot to bring his glove to Little League games. In <i>Awkward</i>, he unpacks decades of research into human intelligence, neuroscience, personality, and sociology to help us better understand this widely shared trait. He explores its nature vs. nurture origins, considers how the awkward view the world, and delivers a welcome counterintuitive message: the same characteristics that make people socially clumsy can be harnessed to produce remarkable achievements. </p> <p>Interweaving the latest research with personal tales and real world examples, <i>Awkward</i> offers reassurance and provides valuable insights into how we can embrace our personal quirks and unique talents to harness our awesome potential - and more comfortably navigate our complex world. </p>","Payoff, The Science of Happily Ever After, How to Be Yourself, Your Brain Is a Time Machine, No Stopping You!, Quiet, Consciousness and the Brain, Popular, Emotional Intelligence, Tiny Habits, Think Like a Rocket Scientist, This Is Your Brain on Parasites, The Molecule of More, The Tangled Tree, Get Smart, NeuroTribes, Biography of Resistance, The Lost Art of Listening, Second Edition",https://audible.com/pd/B06XD8XCS9?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/005974/bk_harp_005974_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B06XD8XCS9,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kcFev+enL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Ty%20Tashiro%20-%20Awkward

Mainstream science - as well as religious and cultural institutions - has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages. </p> <p>How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha. While debunking almost everything we ""know"" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book. </p> <p>Ryan and Jetha's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity. </p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO: Includes a Preface written and read by author Christopher Ryan.</b></p>","Civilized to Death, Polysecure, The Unplugged Alpha, The Tactical Guide to Women, Bachelor Pad Economics, Insatiable Wives, The Smart Girl's Guide to Polyamory, The Happiness Hypothesis, Guns, Germs and Steel, Sapiens, Hold Me Tight, The Selfish Gene, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, The Myth of Male Power, The Book of Numbers, God Is Not Great, The Righteous Mind, The God Delusion",https://audible.com/pd/B004966PJQ?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/002536/bk_adbl_002536_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B004966PJQ,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uM1IHthhL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Christopher%20Ryan%20-%20Sex%20at%20Dawn

James portrays every character in a small Jersey Shore town as he unravels the story of Leonard Pelkey, a tenaciously optimistic and flamboyant 14-year-old boy who has gone missing. A luminous force of nature whose magic is only truly felt once he is gone, Leonard becomes an unexpected inspiration as the town’s citizens question how they live, who they love, and what they leave behind.&nbsp;</p> <p>Brash detective Chuck DeSantis seeks out answers as to why Leonard is missing. Along the way, questions about the teen’s sexuality force members of the community to confront their own biases and beliefs. This poetic piece of audio leads listeners down an important path towards understanding and acceptance. The entire town changes forever because of Leonard Pelkey - a character originally from James Lecesne’s young adult book <i>Absolute Brightness</i> that inspired the play.

R. James.</p> <p><i>Casting the Runes</i> - adapted by Stephen Gallagher</p> <p>When academic Jo Harrington (Anna Maxwell Martin) is sent a paper - <i>The Truth of Alchemy</i>, by Anton Karswell - for peer review, she pulls no punches. It has no place in a serious academic publication, and Karswell is a half-bright fool. However, when the editor writes a rejection note to Karswell, he inadvertently includes her entire email. Occultist Karswell (Reece Shearsmith) doesn’t take kindly to criticism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>On the tube home with her partner Edward Dunning (Tom Burke), Jo spots a poster with her name on it. It reads: 'In memory of Joanne Harrington, M.Litt, PhD, died September eighteenth, three days were allowed.' Is there anything that Edward can do to save Jo from this curse?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Lost Hearts</i> - adapted by A. K. Benedict</p> <p>Teenager Stephanie Elliot (Rosa Coduri) is taken to Aswarby House to be fostered by Mrs Bunch (Susan Jameson). Stephanie strikes up a friendship with Ben (Bill Milner), the adopted son of charismatic community leader Mr Abney (Jeff Rawle). He tells her that Mr Abney is a good man: he even took in a child refugee last year, but she ran away and stole from him. Stephanie is troubled by voices and visions of a dead girl clutching at her chest, and when Ben disappears she begins to suspect that all is not right in Aswarby House.</p> <p><i>The Treasure of Abbot-Thomas</i> - adapted by Jonathan Barnes</p> <p>When former Somerton school pupil Greg Parsbury (Robert Bathurst) meets history teacher Mika Chantry (Pearl Mackie) at a memorial service for schoolmaster Sam Abbot-Thomas, he begs for her help. He has been sent a postcard by the estate of the mysterious and charismatic Abbot-Thomas. On it is a strange inscription in Latin, which he believes to be an inaugural clue in a treasure hunt: much like the elaborate treasure hunts Abbot-Thomas used to set back in the 1970s. There were rumours that Abbot-Thomas possessed a hidden fortune, and Parsbury and Chantry set out to find it.</p> <p><i>A View from a Hill </i>- adapted by Mark Morris</p> <p>Comedian and podcaster Paul Fanshawe (Andy Nyman) and his wife, Sarah (Alice Lowe), visit the Cotswolds on holiday, trying to rebuild their lives after the death of their young son, Archie. Whilst out walking they spot a beautiful abbey across the valley on Gallows Hill, but when they reach it, they find the building is little more than rubble. While Sarah explores, Paul records commentary for his podcast. Sarah thinks she hears children’s laughter, but there’s no-one there. Later that night she listens back to the recording and hears a child’s voice whisper, 'Mummy.' Sarah is convinced that Archie is trying to reach them and wants to return to the ruins. But something far worse is waiting for them on Gallows Hill.</p>","The M. R.

A captivating history of two men who dramatically changed their contemporaries' view of the past."" (<i>Kirkus</i>) </p> <p>In 1839 rumors of extraordinary yet baffling stone ruins buried within the unmapped jungles of Central America reached two of the world's most intrepid travelers. Seized by the reports, American diplomat John Lloyd Stephens and British artist Frederick Catherwood - each already celebrated for their adventures in Egypt, the Holy Land, Greece, and Rome - sailed together out of New York Harbor on an expedition into the forbidding rainforests of present-day Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico. What they found would rewrite the West's understanding of human history. </p> <p>In the tradition of <i>The Lost City of Z</i> and <i>In the Kingdom of Ice</i>, former <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> journalist and Pulitzer Prize finalist William Carlsen reveals the unforgettable true story of the discovery of the ancient Maya. Enduring disease, war, and the torments of nature and terrain, Stephens and Catherwood uncovered and documented the remains of an astonishing civilization that had flourished in the Americas at the same time as classic Greece and Rome. Their remarkable book about the experience became a sensation and is recognized today as the birth of American archeology. Most importantly, Stephens and Catherwood were the first to grasp the significance of the Maya remains, recognizing that their antiquity and sophistication overturned the West's assumptions about the development of civilization. </p> <p>By the time of the flowering of classical Greece (400 BC), the Maya were already constructing pyramids and temples around central plazas. Within a few hundred years, the structures took on a monumental scale. Over the next millennium dozens of city-states evolved, each governed by powerful lords, some with populations larger than any city in Europe at the time. The Maya developed a unified cosmology, an array of common gods, a creation story, and a shared artistic and architectural vision. They created dazzling stucco and stone monuments and bas reliefs, sculpting figures and hieroglyphs with refined artistic skill. At their peak an estimated 10 million people occupied the Maya's heartland on the Yucatan Peninsula. And yet, by the time the Spanish reached the ""New World"", the classic-era Maya had all but disappeared; they would remain a mystery for the next 300 years. </p> <p>Today the tables are turned: The Maya are justly famous, if sometimes misunderstood, while Stephens and Catherwood have been all but forgotten. Based on Carlsen's rigorous research and his own 2,500-mile journey throughout the Yucatan and Central America, <i>Jungle of Stone</i> is equally a thrilling adventure narrative and a revelatory work of history that corrects our understanding of the Maya and the two remarkable men who set out in 1839 to find them. </p>","Island of the Blue Foxes, River of Darkness, Into Africa, Island of the Lost, The Lost City of the Monkey God, Labyrinth of Ice, Barons of the Sea, A Land So Strange, Sea People, Conquistador, The Maya (Ninth Edition), The Lost City of Z, Skeletons on the Zahara, Pacific, Astoria, The Last Days of the Incas, Rasputin, Farther Than Any Man",https://audible.com/pd/B01AIVHULM?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/005079/bk_harp_005079_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B01AIVHULM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xxHgsHNuL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=William%20Carlsen%20-%20Jungle%20of%20Stone

Reconstruction pitted poor white trash against newly freed slaves, which factored in the rise of eugenics.

In <i>Benjamin Franklin</i>, Isaacson shows how Franklin defines both his own time and ours. </p> <p>The most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people"". Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively. </p> <p>In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the 21st century.</p>","Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, Washington, Steve Jobs, The Innovators, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Titan, Kissinger, The Code Breaker, The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, Grant, Churchill, The Wise Men, Team of Rivals, Truman, The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt",https://audible.com/pd/B004VA8ZVQ?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/005486/bk_sans_005486_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B004VA8ZVQ,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zcpKItWZL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Walter%20Isaacson%20-%20Benjamin%20Franklin%3A%20An%20American%20Life

An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths, teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. </p> <p>He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath. Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their maddest edges.</p>","Them: Adventures with Extremists, The Men Who Stare at Goats, So You've Been Publicly Shamed, Without Conscience, The Elephant in the Room, The Sociopath Next Door, Lost at Sea: The Jon Ronson Mysteries, Origin Story, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat: and Other Clinical Tales, Incognito, Snakes in Suits, Revised Edition, How Emotions Are Made, The Wisdom of Psychopaths, Frank, Lies My Teacher Told Me, Run, The Daily Show (the AudioBook), The Tipping Point",https://audible.com/pd/B00507AXAA?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/001975/bk_tant_001975_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00507AXAA,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OW2syCGiL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Jon%20Ronson%20-%20The%20Psychopath%20Test

But she will also find two allies: Cardinal Chang, a brutal assassin with the heart of a poet, and a royal doctor named Svenson, at once fumbling and heroic; both of whom, like her, lost someone at Harschmort Manor.

She conjures up early operating theaters - no place for the squeamish - and surgeons, working before anesthesia, who were lauded for their speed and brute strength. These medical pioneers knew that the aftermath of surgery was often more dangerous than their patients' afflictions, and they were baffled by the persistent infections that kept mortality rates stubbornly high. At a time when surgery couldn't have been more hazardous, an unlikely figure stepped forward: a young, melancholy Quaker surgeon named Joseph Lister, who would solve the deadly riddle and change the course of history. </p> <p>Fitzharris dramatically recounts Lister's discoveries in gripping detail, culminating in his audacious claim that germs were the source of all infection - and could be countered by antiseptics. Focusing on the tumultuous period from 1850 to 1875, she introduces us to Lister and his contemporaries - some of them brilliant, some outright criminal - and takes us through the grimy medical schools and dreary hospitals where they learned their art, the deadhouses where they studied anatomy, and the graveyards they occasionally ransacked for cadavers. </p> <p>Eerie and illuminating, <i>The Butchering Art </i>celebrates the triumph of a visionary surgeon whose quest to unite science and medicine delivered us into the modern world. </p>","Quackery, The Late Middle Ages, The Girls of Atomic City, The Icepick Surgeon, The Terror of History: Mystics, Heretics, and Witches in the Western Tradition, Crisis in the Red Zone, Damnation Island, Alexander the Great, Hallucinations, The Plantagenets, Dr. Mutter's Marvels, Do No Harm, One Doctor, Working Stiff, Drugged: The Science and Culture Behind Psychotropic Drugs, Venomous, The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth, The Fear Factor",https://audible.com/pd/B075Y1KNTZ?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/031254/bk_adbl_031254_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B075Y1KNTZ,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51R-bzs61nL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Lindsey%20Fitzharris%20-%20The%20Butchering%20Art

Suddenly Offi is the leader of a band of lovable misfits and outcasts - from a gryphon who would literally kill for omelets to a young dwarf herbalist who is better with bees than with his cudgel to an assertive and cheerful teen witch with a beard as long as her book of curses - all on a journey to the Toot Towers to confront the dastardly villain intent on tearing Pell asunder. These adventurers never fit in anywhere else, but as they become friends, fight mermaids, and get really angry at this one raccoon, they learn that there’s nothing more heroic than being yourself.</p> <p>In <i>No Country for Old Gnomes</i>, Delilah S. Dawson and Kevin Hearne lovingly tweak the tropes of fantasy and fairy tales. Here you’ll find goofy jokes and whimsical puns, but you’ll also find a diverse, feminist, and lighthearted approach to fantasy that will bring a smile to your face and many fine cheeses to your plate.</p>","The Princess Beard, Ink & Sigil, Death & Honey, A Plague of Giants, First Dangle and Other Stories, A Question of Navigation, The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove, Working for Bigfoot, The Kingdom of Gods, The Folklore of Discworld, Project Hail Mary, Gil's All Fright Diner, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Book 1, Monster's Mercy: Book 3, Dungeon Crawler Carl, The Witch's Vacuum Cleaner and Other Stories, Doing Time, The Globe",https://audible.com/pd/0525593683?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/006463/bk_rand_006463_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=0525593683,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KFXRjA4WL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Kevin%20Hearne%20-%20No%20Country%20for%20Old%20Gnomes

It's sort of about porn, but it's about a lot of other things. It's sad, funny, moving and totally unlike some other nonfiction stories about porn - because it isn't judgmental or salacious. It's human and sweet and strange and lovely. It's a mystery story, an adventure. It's also, I think, a new way of telling a story. This season follows a single butterfly effect. The flap of the butterfly’s wings is a boy in Brussels having an idea. His idea is how to get rich from giving the world free online porn. Over seven episodes I trace the consequences of this idea, from consequence through to consequence. If you keep going in this way, where might you end up? It turns out you end up in the most surprising and unexpected places. </i></p> <p><i>So if you're thinking, why do I want to listen to a show about the tech takeover of the porn industry, I have two things to say: </i></p> <p><i>1. Why wouldn't you want to listen to a show about the tech takeover of the porn industry? That's a great idea for a show. </i></p> <p><i>2.

At the end of Episode 3 a woman becomes convinced that she played a part in a murder committed by an Italian priest.

It's a journey that will take McDermid to war zones, fire scenes, and autopsy suites and bring her into contact with both extraordinary bravery and wickedness as she traces the history of forensics from its earliest beginnings to the cutting-edge science of the modern day. </p>","The End Is Always Near, Evil Has a Name, One Doctor, The Terror of History: Mystics, Heretics, and Witches in the Western Tradition, Forensic History: Crimes, Frauds, and Scandals, Hallucinations, Do No Harm, Working Stiff, Damnation Island, The Late Middle Ages, Quackery, People Who Eat Darkness, Venomous, No Stone Unturned, Mindhunter, True Crime Addict, I'll Be Gone in the Dark, Stiff",https://audible.com/pd/B00YW0DK7E?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/high/000968/bk_high_000968_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00YW0DK7E,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PZqyZrP5L._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Val%20McDermid%20-%20Forensics

On the one hand, such a view is the apotheosis of modern cosmology; on the other, it threatens to undermine almost everything we hold cosmologically sacrosanct. The map contains anomalies that challenge our understanding of the universe. It will force us to revisit what is known and what is unknown, to construct a new model of our universe. </p> <p>This is the first book to address what will be an epoch-defining scientific paradigm shift. Stuart Clark will ask if Newton's famous laws of gravity need to be rewritten, if dark matter and dark energy are just celestial phantoms. Can we ever know what happened before the big bang? What's at the bottom of a black hole? Are there universes beyond our own? Does time exist? Are the once immutable laws of physics changing? </p>","Space: 10 Things You Should Know, The Hidden Reality, The Fabric of the Cosmos, The Science of Interstellar, Dark Matter and Dark Energy, Einstein's Cosmos, The Quantum Universe, Billions & Billions, The Story of Earth, The Elegant Universe, Spooky Action at a Distance, Welcome to the Universe, Particle Physics for Non-Physicists: A Tour of the Microcosmos, A Brief History of Time, Ripples in Spacetime, Cosmos, Our Mathematical Universe, Your Brain Is a Time Machine",https://audible.com/pd/B01J2ABCTQ?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/027618/bk_adbl_027618_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B01J2ABCTQ,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gwmiZGb7L._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Stuart%20Clark%20-%20The%20Unknown%20Universe

Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In <i>Norse Mythology</i>, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin's son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of a giant, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman's deft and witty prose emerge the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.&nbsp;</p> <p></p>","Mythos, American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition (A Full Cast Production), Good Omens, Neverwhere, Mythology: Mega Collection, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, Greek Mythology, The Children of Odin, Stardust, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Gospel of Loki, The Graveyard Book: Full-Cast Production, A Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Book 1, The Name of the Wind, Greek Mythology, Eragon, Odd and the Frost Giants",https://audible.com/pd/B01LWUJKQ7?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/005696/bk_harp_005696_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B01LWUJKQ7,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CrEYL26KL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Neil%20Gaiman%20-%20Norse%20Mythology

Mr. Hyde is trapped in Dr. Jekyll' s surgical cabinet, counting the days until he will face capture and be forced to make the ultimate choice about survival. Over the course of four days, he thinks back on what brought him to this moment, and he finally has the chance to tell the story of his brief but marvelous life. In liberating Mr. Hyde from the omniscient perspective of the original story, the author takes us inside the mind Hyde shares with Jekyll as he awakens after many years of dormancy, wide-eyed at being able to explore the world on his own. We feel the potions take effect. We tromp through the streets of London, drink gin in seedy pubs, we visit doll shops and menace the men who take advantage of the women there, and we attempt to rescue lost girls. We feel the strange distance of watching Jekyll' s high-class life through a membrane of consciousness. And then we feel the helplessness of someone being framed for serious crimes. The evidence all points to Hyde. Even if he didn' t intend to commit these crimes, is it possible that they have been perpetrated, without his knowledge, by his own hand?</p>","Who Goes There?, Space Opera, Usher's Passing, Witch, The Ghost Tree, Day Zero, The Craftsman, The Strain, December Park, Suicide Forest, Project Nemesis, The Binding, The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie, The 7 ½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, The House of a Hundred Whispers, The Forest of Stolen Girls, Empire of Wild, The Nesting",https://audible.com/pd/B00ICPL9AA?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/007557/bk_reco_007557_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00ICPL9AA,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51T3FO+ntgL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Daniel%20Levine%20-%20Hyde

Countless hours were spent on the hunt for the elusive orb, and some of the era's most skilled astronomers even claimed to have found it. </p><p>There was just one problem: It was never there. </p><p>In <i>The Hunt for Vulcan</i>, Thomas Levenson follows the visionary scientists who inhabit the story of the phantom planet, starting with Isaac Newton, who, in 1687, provided an explanation for all matter in motion throughout the universe, leading to Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier, who, almost two centuries later, built on Newton's theories and discovered Neptune, becoming the most famous scientist in the world. Le Verrier attempted to surpass that triumph by predicting the existence of yet another planet in our solar system: Vulcan. </p><p>It took Albert Einstein to discern that the mystery of the missing planet was a problem not of measurements or math but of Newton's theory of gravity itself. Einstein's general theory of relativity proved that Vulcan did not and could not exist and that the search for it had merely been a quirk of operating under the wrong set of assumptions about the universe. Levenson tells the previously untold tale of how the ""discovery"" of Vulcan in the 19th century set the stage for Einstein's monumental breakthrough, the greatest individual intellectual achievement of the 20th century. </p><p>A dramatic human story of an epic quest, <i>The Hunt for Vulcan</i> offers insight into how science really advances (as opposed to the way we're taught about it in school) and how the best work of the greatest scientists reveals an artist's sensibility.

In <i>How Not to Be Wrong</i>, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is: Math isn’t confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do—the whole world is shot through with it. </p> <p> Math allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world. It’s a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does “public opinion” really represent? Why do tall parents have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer? </p> <p><i>How Not to Be Wrong</i> presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematician’s method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the layman—minus the jargon. Ellenberg chases mathematical threads through a vast range of time and space, from the everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things, baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire, the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance painting, artificial languages, the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse, Antonin Scalia’s views on crime and punishment, the psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and can’t figure out about you, and the existence of God. </p> <p>Ellenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need. Math, as Ellenberg says, is “an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.” With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. <i>How Not to Be Wrong</i> will show you how. </p>","Shape, Algorithms to Live By, The Art of Statistics, A Mind for Numbers, Thinking, Fast and Slow, The Book of Why, Complexity, Infinite Powers, Humble Pi, Outliers, Rationality, Naked Statistics, Superforecasting, Freakonomics, The Signal and the Noise, The Drunkard's Walk, Fooled by Randomness, The Wisdom of Crowds",https://audible.com/pd/B00KO0AZ74?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/peng/002391/bk_peng_002391_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00KO0AZ74,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41w0iQ8Mf4L._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Jordan%20Ellenberg%20-%20How%20Not%20to%20Be%20Wrong

So when she is working at a diner and slowly begins to realize she can see dead people, she's more than a little taken aback. Stranger still are the people entering her life. They seem to know things about her. Things they hide with lies and half-truths. Soon, she senses something far darker. A force that wants to cause her harm, she is sure of it. Her saving grace comes in the form of a new friend she feels she can confide in and the fry cook, a devastatingly handsome man whose smile is breathtaking and touch is scalding. He stays close, and she almost feels safe with him around.&nbsp;</p> <p>But no one can outrun their past, and the more lies that swirl around her - even from her new and trusted friends - the more disoriented she becomes, until she is confronted by a man who claims to have been sent to kill her.

But that doesn't help in her quest to find her identity and recover what she's lost. That will take all her courage and a touch of the power she feels flowing like electricity through her veins.

He always enjoyed them; he just never thought that they were true. Robert's childhood world of magic becomes real when a chance encounter with a local casino mob boss introduces him to the world he was born into, the world that was hidden from him, the world of the Fae. But he's not easily convinced. </p> <p>From disbelief to acceptance, Robert encounters a variety of mythical beings. From Faeries and Norse legends to the Oracle at Delphi, from Mermaids to Werewolves to everything in between, Robert's world has definitely changed. While his path through that world appears chosen he soon learns that the beings that reside in the world of his grandmother's stories aren't that much different than those of the mortal world. Good and evil still battle one another and it's time to take sides. </p> <p>What should Robert do when the world around him stops making sense? When he has to find out from a Dwarf that his dog is descended from Fae hunting dogs. When he knows that corporations and even the mob don't run Vegas, it's the Fae. When the prettiest girls he meets are over 3,000 years old and some of them drink blood. And that stripper, is she really a Faery? Let's not even go there. What should Robert do when he learns that strength in his new world is measured in magic, and he doesn't have a clue how to wield it? </p> <p>Do Demons, Gods, Elves, and Faeries really exist? Are Vampires truly the children of Lilith?

But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory. <p>But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr. Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.</p> <p>All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative, the very opposite of Mr. Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr. Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr. Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.</p> <p>Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England.

This was the England of Shakespeare, Jonson, and Bacon; the Gunpowder Plot; the worst outbreak of the plague England had ever seen; arcadian landscapes; murderous, toxic slums; and, above all, sometimes overwhelming religious passion. Jacobean England was both more godly and less godly than it had ever been, and the entire culture was drawn taut between the polarities.</p> <p> This was the world that created the King James Bible. It is the greatest work of English prose ever written, and it is no coincidence that the translation was made at the moment “Englishness” and the English language had come into its first passionate maturity. Boisterous, elegant, subtle, majestic, finely nuanced, sonorous, and musical, the English of Jacobean England has a more encompassing idea of its own reach and scope than any before or since. It is a form of the language that drips with potency and sensitivity. The age, with all its conflicts, explains the book.</p> <p> The sponsor and guide of the whole Bible project was the king himself, the brilliant, ugly, and profoundly peace-loving James the Sixth of Scotland and First of England. Trained almost from birth to manage the rivalries of political factions at home, James saw in England the chance for a sort of irenic Eden over which the new translation of the Bible was to preside. It was to be a Bible for everyone, and as God’s lieutenant on earth, he would use it to unify his kingdom. The dream of Jacobean peace, guaranteed by an elision of royal power and divine glory, lies behind a Bible of extraordinary grace and everlasting literary power.</p> <p> Adam Nicolson is the author of <i>Seamanship, God’s Secretaries</i>, and <i>Seize the Fire</i>.

This dandy, who remains forever unchanged---petulant, hedonistic, vain, and amoral---while a painting of him ages and grows increasingly hideous with the years, has been horrifying and enchanting readers for more than 100 years. Taking the reader in and out of London drawing rooms, to the heights of aestheticism, and to the depths of decadence, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is not simply a melodrama about moral corruption. Laced with bon mots and vivid depictions of upper-class refinement, it is also a fascinating look at the milieu of Wilde's fin-de-siècle world and a manifesto of the creed ""Art for Art's Sake.""The ever-quotable Wilde, who once delighted London with his scintillating plays, scandalized readers with this, his only novel. Upon publication, Dorian was condemned as dangerous, poisonous, stupid, vulgar, and immoral, and Wilde as a ""driveling pedant."" The novel, in fact, was used against Wilde at his much-publicized trials for ""gross indecency,"" which led to his imprisonment and exile on the European continent. Even so, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> firmly established Wilde as one of the great voices of the Aesthetic movement and endures as a classic that is as timeless as its hero.","The Divine Comedy, Frankenstein, The Importance of Being Earnest (Dramatized), The Jungle, The Time Machine, The Great Gatsby, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Candide (AmazonClassics Edition), Oliver Twist, All the King's Men, The Invisible Man, Ben-Hur, East of Eden, Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Replay, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Anna Karenina",https://audible.com/pd/B002UZLLDI?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/000756/bk_tant_000756_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B002UZLLDI,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HpqAS235L._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Oscar%20Wilde%20-%20The%20Picture%20of%20Dorian%20Gray

How could the ancient people who inhabited this tiny speck of land, the most remote in the vast expanse of the Pacific islands, have built such monumental works? </p> <p>No such astonishing numbers of massive statues are found anywhere else in the Pacific. How could the islanders possibly have moved so many multi-ton monoliths from the quarry inland, where they were carved, to their posts along the coastline? And most intriguing and vexing of all, if the island once boasted a culture developed and sophisticated enough to have produced such marvelous edifices, what happened to that culture? Why was the island the Europeans encountered a sparsely populated wasteland? </p> <p>The prevailing accounts of the island’s history tell a story of self-inflicted devastation: a glaring case of eco-suicide. The island was dominated by a powerful chiefdom that promulgated a cult of statue making, exercising a ruthless hold on the island’s people and rapaciously destroying the environment, cutting down a lush palm forest that once blanketed the island in order to construct contraptions for moving more and more statues, which grew larger and larger. As the population swelled in order to sustain the statue cult, growing well beyond the island’s agricultural capacity, a vicious cycle of warfare broke out between opposing groups, and the culture ultimately suffered a dramatic collapse. </p> <p>When Terry Hunt and Carl Lipo began carrying out archaeological studies on the island in 2001, they fully expected to find evidence supporting these accounts.

But what is she supposed to do with a nice, suburban Jersey boy in the form of a massive Grizzly shifter? Especially one with a rather unhealthy fetish for honey, moose, and…uh…well, her. Yet despite his menacing ursine growl and four-inch claws, Gwen finds Lachlan ""Lock"" MacRyrie cute and really sweet. He actually watches out for her, protects her, and unlike the rest of her out-of-control family manages not to morbidly embarrass her. Too bad cats don't believe in forever. </p> <p>At nearly seven feet tall, Lock is used to people responding to him in two ways: screaming and running away. Gwen-half lioness, half tigress, all kick-ass-does neither. She's sexy beyond belief and smart as hell, but she's a born protector. She watches out for the family and friends closest to her but misses the fact that she's being stalked by a murderous enemy who doesn't like hybrids…and absolutely hates Gwen. Lock probably shouldn't get involved, but he will. Why? Because this is Gwen - and no matter what the hissing, roaring, drape-destroying feline says about not being ready to settle down, Lock knows he can't simply walk away. Not when she's come to mean absolutely everything to him. </p>","Howl for It, Dragon Actually, When He's Dark, My Commander, Burn, Kodiak Point Anthology, Spiral of Need, The Lasaran, Pride Mates, Seven Years, The Next Always, How to Flirt with a Naked Werewolf, Black Hills, Halfway to the Grave, How to Date Your Dragon, Rock Chick, The Vampire's Mail Order Bride, Bloodlines",https://audible.com/pd/B00FW5JKRM?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/003345/bk_tant_003345_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00FW5JKRM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hayZoB6wL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Shelly%20Laurenston%20-%20The%20Mane%20Squeeze

And he never thought the woman of his dreams would have a Tennessee accent and wear cowboy boots. Once he sets his sights on her, the predator in him is ready to pounce and never let go. Ronnie Lee Reed is ready to change her life, and New York City is the place where any girl, even one who runs with a Pack, can redefine herself. First order of business: Find a mate, settle down, and stop using men for sex. Even big, gorgeous, lion-shifting, oh-my-what-big-um-paws-you-have men.

Raybould Marsh is a British secret agent in the early days of World War II, haunted by something strange he saw on a mission during the Spanish Civil War: a German woman with wires going into her head who looked at him as if she knew him. It wasn’t his imagination; the wired woman can see into the future and use her knowledge to twist the present.

He rallies a group of secret warlocks in Britain to hold an impending invasion at bay. But magic always exacts a price.

A brilliant young boy, Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut - young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs?&nbsp;</p> <p>But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long.

Running all their daylight errands - from letting in the plumber to picking up some chilled O neg - gives her a look at the not-so-glamorous side of vampire life. Her rules are strict; relationships with vamps are strictly business, not friendship - and certainly not anything else. But then she finds her newest client, Cal, poisoned on his kitchen floor, and only Iris can help. </p> <p>Cal - who would be devastatingly sexy, if Iris allowed herself to think that way - offers Iris a hefty fee for hiding him at her place until he figures out who wants him permanently dead. Even though he's imperious, unfriendly, and doesn't seem to understand the difference between ""employee"" and ""servant"", Iris agrees, and finds herself breaking more and more of her own rules to help him - particularly those concerning nudity. Turns out what her quiet little life needed was some intrigue and romance - in the form of her very own stray vampire.</p>","How to Flirt with a Naked Werewolf, Ain't She a Peach, Fledgling, Rhythm and Bluegrass, How to Date Your Dragon, Pasties and Poor Decisions, A Little Night Magic, The Vampire's Mail Order Bride, I Loved You First, Sucks to Be Me, Sin & Chocolate, The Siren Saves the Billionaire, House of the Rising Sun, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Book 1, The Beechwood Harbor Magic Mysteries Boxed Set, The Eye of the World, Enchanted, Inc., Halfway to the Grave",https://audible.com/pd/B008PEB3HM?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/004666/bk_adbl_004666_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B008PEB3HM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dmjsMG0OL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Molly%20Harper%20-%20The%20Care%20and%20Feeding%20of%20Stray%20Vampires

Amelia Peabody and her husband, Emerson, are relaxing at home in Kent, enjoying the tranquil beauty of summer. But adventure soon beckons when they are persuaded to follow would-be archaeologist Major George Morley on an expedition to Palestine. Searching for the vanished treasures of the Temple in Jerusalem, Morley is determined to unearth the legendary Ark of the Covenant.</p> <p>The skeptical Emerson wants no part of the scheme, until a request from the War Office and Buckingham Palace persuades him to reconsider. The Germans are increasing their influence in Palestine and British intelligence insists that Morley is an agent of the Kaiser, sent to stir up trouble in this politically volatile land. Emerson can't believe that the seemingly inept Morley is a German spy, but could he be mistaken?</p> <p>Determined to prevent a catastrophically unprofessional excavation that could destroy priceless historical finds as well as cause an armed protest by infuriated Christians, Jews, and Muslims who view the Temple Mount, also known as the Dome of the Rock, as sacred, Amelia, Emerson, and company head to Palestine. Though it is not to her beloved Egypt, the trip to Jerusalem will also reunite her with her handsome and headstrong son, Ramses, working on a dig at Samaria, north of the holy city.</p> <p>Before Ramses can meet his parents, however, he is distracted by an unusual party of travelers who have arrived in Samaria, including a German woman archaeologist and a mysterious man of unknown nationality and past. Unfortunately, Ramses's insatiable curiosity and his knack for trouble lead him to a startling discovery: information he must pass on to his parents in Jerusalem, if he can get there alive.</p>","The Painted Queen, The Amazing Mrs. Pollifax, Naked Once More, The Whispered Word, The Dead Sea Cipher, The Copenhagen Connection, Louisiana Longshot, Masked Ball at Broxley Manor, Murder at Melrose Court, Observations by Gaslight, The Beekeeper's Apprentice, or On the Segregation of the Queen, Murder in an English Village, Murder at Archly Manor, A Very English Murder, Good Omens, The Crown Tower, Off to Be the Wizard, Theft of Swords",https://audible.com/pd/B003DO2URQ?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/002147/bk_harp_002147_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B003DO2URQ,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nR5ygmElL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Elizabeth%20Peters%20-%20A%20River%20in%20the%20Sky

This one-of-a-kind performance puts a unique spin on a treasured classic, and served as the inspiration for the exciting new line of Audible Signature Classics, including <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> with Elijah Wood, and <i>Heart of Darkness</i> with Kenneth Branagh. Tim Curry performs this timeless holiday story in a deliciously dark tone, returning it to its Dickensian roots with a vivid imagining of Victorian London and just the right touch of outrageous fun. </p> <p><i>A Christmas Carol</i> has constantly been in print since its original publication in 1849, and has been adapted for stage, television, film, and opera. It has often been credited with returning the jovial and festive atmosphere to the holiday season in Britain and North America, following the somber period that emerged during the Industrial Revolution.</p> <p>The story opens on a bleak and cold Christmas Eve as Ebenezer Scrooge is closing up his office for the day. As the story progresses and Christmas morning approaches, Scrooge encounters the unforgettable characters that make this story a classic: Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, and, of course, the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come.</p>","Jacob T.

But in this autumn of 1915 the exotic, alluring city is not what it used to be. Cairo has been transformed into an armed camp teeming with enemy agents, and shockingly bold tomb robbers are brazenly desecrating the ancient sites.</p> <p> Amelia's foremost priority is to prevent the War Office from pressing Ramses into service again, on the same sort of job that almost cost him his life the previous year. But in these terrible days of global conflict and relentless skullduggery, no place in Egypt is safe. Even remote Luxor provides no guarantee of safety, especially after Amelia discovers a fresh corpse resting in an ancient tomb.</p> <p> The grim discovery presages further trouble for the Emersons, as the sinister conundrum pulls them all into a bubbling morass of corruption, intrigue, and international espionage deeper and more fiendish than any they have hitherto encountered. Death follows death, with abduction and an assault on Amelia herself intensifying the chaos of a world at war.</p> <p> Yet there is an even darker danger in store for the Emersons. Can it be that one of Amelia's oldest and most dangerous adversaries will intervene to alter the family's destiny? Tantalizing clues suggest that this may be so and point toward an archaeological discovery of unparalleled importance, and the resurrection of a voice that has been silent for millennia.</p>","The Golden One, Crocodile on the Sandbank, Laughter of Dead Kings, Naked Once More, The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax, The Copenhagen Connection, The Dead Sea Cipher, Murder at Melrose Court, Murder in an English Village, Masked Ball at Broxley Manor, Louisiana Longshot, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Be Buried in the Rain, The Dancing Floor, Murder at the Mayfair Hotel, The Beekeeper's Apprentice, or On the Segregation of the Queen, Stitches in Time, A Very English Murder",https://audible.com/pd/B002V5GOCA?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/harp/001099/bk_harp_001099_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B002V5GOCA,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EnngwuOQL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Elizabeth%20Peters%20-%20Lord%20of%20the%20Silent

In later centuries, Paul was scorned by such writers as Thomas Jefferson, George Bernard Shaw, and Nietzsche.<p> In this masterly analysis, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Garry Wills chronicles Paul's tremendous influence on the first explosion of Christian belief, the controversy surrounding Paul through the centuries, and the meaning of his words. He argues eloquently that what Paul meant was not contrary to what Jesus meant. Rather, the best way to know Jesus is to discover Paul. Unlike the Gospel writers, who carefully shaped their narratives many decades after Jesus' life, Paul wrote in the heat of the moment, offering the best reflection of those early times.</p>","What Jesus Meant, What the Gospels Meant, What the Qur'an Meant, Lincoln at Gettysburg, Saint Augustine, The Dawn of Everything, Learning to Pray, The First Paul, Beowulf, Catholicism, Before the Storm, Fantasyland, Great Expectations, A Distant Mirror, The God Delusion, Short Stories by Jesus, The Great War and Modern Memory, No God but One: Allah or Jesus?",https://audible.com/pd/B002V1C7CU?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/001933/bk_blak_001933_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B002V1C7CU,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51moz-X2QdL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Garry%20Wills%20-%20What%20Paul%20Meant

Grendel is a horrible monster who greedily gobbles up warriors in the Danish mead hall guarded by Beowulf. But within Grendel lurks a soul that delights in dark humor, dramatic pirouettes, and pranks. Both young adult and adult listeners will revel in this powerful complement to a classic tale.</p> <p> George Guidall's narration captures a surreal landscape that shimmers on the other side of the original epic's heroic mirror.

But summoning Bartimaeus and controlling him are two different things entirely, and when Nathaniel sends the djinni out to steal Lovelace's greatest treasure, the Amulet of Samarkand, he finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of magical espionage, murder and rebellion.</p> <p>Set in a modern-day London spiced with magicians and mystery, <i>The Amulet of Samarkand</i> is an extraordinary, edge-of-your-seat thriller with many unexpected twists. Following Bartimaeus and Nathaniel in turn, the story introduces us to two wonderfully memorable characters destined to go through many adventures together and bound by a spell that is nearly impossible to break.</p>","The Golem's Eye, Lockwood & Co.: The Screaming Staircase, Book 1, Peter and the Starcatchers, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Book 1, The Outlaws Scarlett and Browne, Magyk, Eragon, Dragonwatch, Sabriel, The Eye of the World, The Golden Compass, The Hobbit, Savvy, The Wee Free Men, Jackaby, Winter, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe",https://audible.com/pd/B002V8H22I?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.com/bk/lili/000022/bk_lili_000022_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B002V8H22I,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51CsxMhhVFL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Jonathan%20Stroud%20-%20The%20Amulet%20of%20Samarkand%3A%20The%20Bartimaeus%20Trilogy%2C%20Book%201

Or perhaps as Merry Gentry, Los Angeles private eye. In the fey and mortal realms alike, my life is the stuff of royal intrigue and celebrity drama. Among my own, I have confronted horrendous enemies, endured my noble kin's treachery and malevolence, and honored my duty to conceive a royal heir - all for the right to claim the throne. But I turned my back on court and crown, choosing exile in the human world - and in the arms of my beloved Frost and Darkness.</p> <p>While I may have rejected the monarchy, I cannot abandon my people. Someone is killing the fey, which has left the LAPD baffled and my guardsmen and me deeply disturbed. My kind are not easily captured or killed. At least not by mortals. I must get to the bottom of these horrendous murders, even if that means going up against Gilda, the Fairy Godmother, my rival for fey loyalties in Los Angeles.</p> <p>But even stranger things are happening. Mortals I once healed with magic are suddenly performing miracles, a shocking phenomenon wreaking havoc on human/faerie relations. Though I am innocent, dark suspicions of banned magical activities swirl around me.</p> <p>I thought I'd left the blood and politics behind in my own turbulent realm. I had dreamed of an idyllic life in sunny L.A. with my beloved ones beside me.
