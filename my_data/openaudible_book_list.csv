From infancy to adulthood, Stephen struggles to find his place, flitting between periods of guilt-ridden fanatical religious obsession and hedonistic exploration. But even as he is pulled in every direction by family, flesh, faith, and nation, Stephen longs for something seemingly forbidden–the life of an artist.</p> <p>Joyce’s first work to experiment with stream of consciousness style—a technique that he and his contemporaries developed—<i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> evokes both the pains and complexities of growing up and the furious optimism that accompanies youth. Pulling from events from his own past, Joyce weaves a semi-autobiographical recount of life in nineteenth century Ireland, crafting a narrative that is at once tender and sharply satirical. When combined with Farrell’s gentle brogue, Joyce’s tale soars, as much a portrait of the artist as it is a portrait of Ireland itself. </p>","<p>This quintessential coming-of-age novel describes the early life of Stephen Dedalus. <i>A Portrait...</i> follows Stephen Dedalus from his babyhood into early adulthood and is notable for being the first work in which Joyce uses his innovative “stream of consciousness” writing style.....</p>","08:17:00","4.14274322169059","1254","2019-01-22","2019-07-01","Audible Studios","Literature & Fiction:Classics","","A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man","","https://www.audible.com/author/James+Joyce/B000AQ0JHI","","A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L8AKfB9+L._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

Bills were piling up, adding up to more money than I could ever make. Mom's hospital bills. My baby brother's tuition. My tuition. Rent. Electricity. All of it on my shoulders. And I had just lost my job. There was no hope, no money in my account, no work to be found. And then, just when I thought all hope was lost, I found an envelope in the mail. No return address. My name on the front, my address. Inside was a check, made out to me, in the amount of 10 thousand dollars. Enough to pay the bills and leave me some left over to live on until I found a job. Enough to let me focus on classes. There was no name on the check, just ""VRI Inc."", and a post office box address for somewhere in the city. No hint of identity or reason for the check or anything. No mention of repayment, interest, nothing...except a single word, on the notes line: ""You"". Just those three letters. </p> <p> If you received a mysterious check, for enough money to erase all your worries, would you cash it? </p> <p> I did. </p> <p> The next month, I received another check, again from VRI Incorporated.

While modern social life can make even the best of us feel gawky, for roughly one in five of us, navigating its challenges is consistently overwhelming - an ongoing maze without an exit. Often unable to grasp social cues or master the skills and grace necessary for smooth interaction, we feel out of sync with those around us. Though individuals may recognize their awkward disposition, they rarely understand why they are like this - which makes it hard for them to know how to adjust their behavior. </p> <p>Psychologist and interpersonal relationship expert Ty Tashiro knows what it's like to be awkward. Growing up, he could do math in his head and memorize the earned run averages of every National League starting pitcher. But he couldn't pour liquids without spilling and habitually forgot to bring his glove to Little League games. In <i>Awkward</i>, he unpacks decades of research into human intelligence, neuroscience, personality, and sociology to help us better understand this widely shared trait. He explores its nature vs. nurture origins, considers how the awkward view the world, and delivers a welcome counterintuitive message: the same characteristics that make people socially clumsy can be harnessed to produce remarkable achievements. </p> <p>Interweaving the latest research with personal tales and real world examples, <i>Awkward</i> offers reassurance and provides valuable insights into how we can embrace our personal quirks and unique talents to harness our awesome potential - and more comfortably navigate our complex world. </p>","As humans, we all need to belong.

In <i>Benjamin Franklin</i>, Isaacson shows how Franklin defines both his own time and ours. </p> <p>The most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people"". Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively. </p> <p>In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the 21st century.</p>","Benjamin Franklin is the founding father who winks at us - an ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings....","24:40:00","4.5269091397127905","7451","2011-04-07","2019-06-24","Simon & Schuster Audio","Biographies & Memoirs:Historical","","Benjamin Franklin: An American Life","","https://www.audible.com/author/Walter+Isaacson/B000APFLB8","","Benjamin Franklin An American Life","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zcpKItWZL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

This is <i>Bluebird Memories</i>, part of Audible's Words + Music that blends storytelling, music, and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience.</p> <p>Written and conceived by Common with Awoye Timpo and NSangou Njikam, originally recorded live at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York City, and backed by a world-class band including special guest appearance by Robert Glasper and an ensemble of vocalists, <i>Bluebird Memories</i> tracks Common’s intimate journey from childhood to manhood. At its heart, it serves as both an open letter to his estranged father and a personal meditation on the quest for greater self-understanding, self-worth, and connection to the world that surrounds him.</p> <p>As a young artist, introduced to the work of literary icons from James Baldwin and Gwendolyn Brooks to Rakim and Melle Mel, Common would grow to use their works as motivation and a high-water mark for what would become his life in words. In a performance that recounts stories about growing up in Chicago, discovering hip-hop, longing for a consistent father, and his awakening into Black consciousness, the evolution of Common, as son, as man, artist, and activist, is all here - unpacked and laid bare.</p> <p>At just under two hours, <i>Bluebird Memories</i> is constantly in motion, soaring with emotion and pulsing with raw vitality. Seamlessly blending, stretching, and playing with forms, Common slides between poetry and candid conversation, kicks into one of his classic tracks, and backs out into a moment of nearly silent reflection. For those hip-hop heads, the treat of hearing Common bounce between bars of his own self-admitted cringey party raps to rapturously reciting classic hip-hop’s most revered verses is a joy to behold. (Yes, bumping human beatbox included.) In a performance that calls forth the spirit and legacy of so many artists, thinkers, and heroes who informed both his artistry and personal philosophy, Common invites listeners to experience him in his totality. A finely tuned instrument capable of conveying a sweeping breadth of power, range, and tone. Listen to a modern icon deliver at the top of his craft.</p>","<p>In a performance that combines the personal and poetic with the literary and the lyrical, Grammy, Oscar, Emmy, and Golden Globe-winning artist Common spins something entirely new and bold for both his old-school fans and those new to one of hip-hop’s most essential voices....</p>","01:21:00","4.456379498364231","3668","2020-08-04","2020-08-07","Audible Originals","Arts & Entertainment:Entertainment & Performing Arts","","Bluebird Memories","","https://www.audible.com/author/Common/B0052XYJUC","","Bluebird Memories","","https://www.audible.com/series/Words-Music-Audiobook/B08JD4NTB1","Words + Music","","","","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516mu-GabiL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

Taylor says his early life is, ""the source of many of my songs"", and <i>Break Shot</i> is a tour of his first 21 years in rich, new detail. Praised by Forbes magazine as going ""beyond the spoken word"", <i>Break Shot </i>combines storytelling, music and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience. Longtime fans will savor a crop of musical gems, including an unreleased recording of the beloved hymn ""Jerusalem"", selections from his newest release <i>American Standard</i>, as well as new original scoring by Taylor specially recorded for <i>Break Shot</i> and more from the Grammy Award-winning artist.</p> <p>Recorded in his home studio, The Barn in western Massachusetts, Taylor tells the deeply personal story of his youth, which is entwined with the story of his family. What started as an idyllic tight unit soon became a family sent to different emotional corners - like a break shot in the game of pool, he says, when you slam the cue ball into the fifteen other balls and they all go flying off. By the time Taylor released his breakout second album in 1970, <i>Sweet Baby James</i>, he had seen the disintegration of his parents’ marriage and his family crumble in the aftermath. He had committed himself twice to a psychiatric hospital, battled depression, a heroin addiction, suffered a relapse, and traveled far away from the wood smoke and moonshine of the North Carolina landscapes in which he came of age.

Landing at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the spacefarer, Hollus, asks to compare notes on mass extinctions with resident dino-scientist Thomas Jericho. A shocked Jericho finds that not only does life exist on other planets, but that every civilization in the galaxy has experienced extinction events at precisely the same time. Armed with that disconcerting information (and a little help from a grand unifying theory), the alien informs Jericho, almost dismissively, that the primary goal of modern science is to discover why God has behaved as he has and to determine his methods. <p>BONUS AUDIO: Author Robert J.

Paradoxically characterized as both barbaric and innocent, the Celts appeal to the modern world as a symbol of a bygone era, a world destroyed by the ambition of empire and the spread of Christianity throughout Western Europe. Despite the pervasive cultural and literary influence of the Celts, shockingly little is known of their way of life and beliefs, because very few records of their stories exist. In this book, for the first time, Philip Freeman brings together the best stories of Celtic mythology. </p> <p>Everyone today knows about the gods and heroes of the ancient Greeks, such as Zeus, Hera, and Hercules, but how many people have heard of the Gaulish god Lugus or the magical Welsh queen Rhiannon or the great Irish warrior Cú Chulainn? We still thrill to the story of the Trojan War, but the epic battles of the Irish Táin Bó Cuailgne are known only to a few. And yet those who have read the stories of Celtic myth and legend - among them writers like J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis - have been deeply moved and influenced by these amazing tales, for there is nothing in the world quite like them. In these stories a mysterious and invisible realm of gods and spirits exists alongside and sometimes crosses over into our own human world; fierce women warriors battle with kings and heroes, and even the rules of time and space can be suspended. Captured in vivid prose these shadowy figures - gods, goddesses, and heroes - come to life for the modern listener. </p>","In this book, for the first time, Philip Freeman brings together the best stories of Celtic mythology....","07:31:00","4.09144893111639","842","2017-10-26","2020-08-02","Brilliance Audio","Literature & Fiction:Ancient, Classical & Medieval Literature:Collections","","Celtic Mythology","","https://www.audible.com/author/Philip+Freeman/B001IOBGP0","","Celtic Mythology","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/515rYqmg0qL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

It is here, under the constant threat of exploding shells and artillery, that British and German soldiers live in deplorable conditions. Braving the merciless cold and crushing exhaustion and hunger, the men conduct patrols and fight, often to the death, to advance mere inches in the frozen No Man’s Land that lies between them.</p> <p>But on Christmas Eve, the Western Front gives way to a miracle of grace, as soldiers from both sides emerge from their trenches to greet each other, share their meager rations, and bury the dead for an unofficial and temporary truce. Drawing upon the unforgettable true story of history’s most transcendent ceasefire, this Audible Original, a finalist for the 2016 Audie Award for Best Audio Drama, commemorates an astonishing moment of peace—and celebration of man’s capacity for kindness—in the midst of total war. A full cast performance of a heart-wrenching script written by Emmy Award-winner Charles Olivier and produced by Dawn Prestwich (<i>The Killing</i>), <i>Christmas Eve, 1914</i> is the perfect reminder of how holiday hope can be found in the unlikeliest of places.

Sir Richard Francis Burton, an explorer, a linguist, a scholar, and the king's agent - or is he a puppet being manipulated by forces he cannot understand? A race to find the source of the Nile! Algernon Charles Swinburne - a famous young flame-haired poet, thrill-seeker, and follower of the Marquis de Sade. For him, pain is pleasure, and brandy is ruin! Back to where the adventure began! </p><p>It is 1863, but not the one it should be. Time has veered wildly off course, and moves are being made that will lead to a devastating world war. Prime Minister Lord Palmerston believes that by possessing the three Eyes of Naga he'll be able to manipulate events and avoid the war. He already has two of the stones, but he needs Sir Richard Francis Burton to recover the third. For the king's agent, it's a chance to return to the Mountains of the Moon to make a second attempt at locating the source of the Nile. But a rival expedition led by John Hanning Speke stands in his way, threatening a confrontation that could ignite the very war that Palmerston is trying to avoid! </p><p>Caught in a tangled web of cause, effect, and inevitability, little does Burton realize that the stakes are far higher than even he suspects. A final confrontation comes in London, where, in the year 1840, Burton must face the man responsible for altering time—Spring Heeled Jack! </p><p>Burton and Swinburne's third adventure completes the three-volume story arc begun in <i>The Strange Affair of Spring Heeled Jack</i> and <i>The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man</i>.</p>","It is 1863, but not the one it should be.

Told through two intersecting timelines, the grand finale to Rachel Vincent's stunning Menagerie series will reveal the secret of how Delilah Marlow became a furiae just as she discovers what her true purpose is. </p> <p>In 1986, humanity experienced the Reaping - a nationwide slaughter of six-year-old children by their parents - one of the country's most horrific tragedies. What's even more terrifying: the revelation that the few six-year-old survivors of the country's greatest tragedy are now thought to have caused it.</p> <p>These aren't the children their families believed they were. In truth, they were fae changelings brought home from the hospital in place of the real babies for whom they were exchanged. From that day forward, the world would never trust another cryptid. For if the fae were capable of such dark evil, surely all cryptid creatures posed a danger to humanity. </p> <p>Now, Delilah Marlow and a rogue group of cryptids are on the run, having narrowly escaped the horrors of the Savage Spectacle, a private collection of ""exotic wildlife"" that specialized in ruthless cryptid cage matches, safari-style creature hunts, and living party favors. As they travel in search of lost family members and cryptid friends, Delilah struggles with the difficulties of pregnancy, complicated by the bitter memory of how her child was conceived. </p> <p>Then one morning, Delilah wakes up with dried blood all over her hands. Though she has no memory of it, she obviously went somewhere - and possibly killed someone - in her sleep. Soon, Delilah finds herself constantly pulled by the furiae, which she hasn't felt stir within her in quite a while, but who she has no choice but to follow. </p> <p>As she is compelled to act on the furiae's impulses, she's beginning to realize something much bigger is at stake. There is something connecting her victims, something more than the usual injustice she kills them for - and perhaps something as dangerous as another Reaping.</p>","<p>In 1986, humanity experienced the Reaping - a nationwide slaughter of six-year-old children by their parents - one of the country's most horrific tragedies.

One of our major commitments is bringing new and diverse audio experiences to our members, so this year, as our gift to you, we pulled together a collection that reflects a little bit of everything we've been up to recently: a surprising and heartwarming documentary, a selection of stories from our partners around the world, and even some improvised comedic carols we hope will make you laugh as much as they did us. </p><p><u><b>The lineup includes: </b></u></p><p><i><b>Zip Code 12345 </b></i></p><p>This mini-documentary centers around a peculiar holiday tradition at General Electric's headquarters in Schenectady, NY. For two decades, GE has been receiving thousands of letters from kids - children who think they're reaching Santa Claus. And every year, a handful of GE employees give up their December lunchbreaks to respond to each and every letter. </p><p><i><b>An Aussie Night Before Christmas</b></i><b>, by Yvonne Morrison, performed by Magda Szubanksi </b></p><p><b><i></i></b>This rollicking rewrite of the famous old poem <i>'Twas The Night Before Christmas</i> gives the original version a hilarious Aussie twist.

In the process, he opens up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations and laugh at their absurdity. </p> <p>Beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funny, <i>Go the F**k to Sleep</i> is a book for parents new, old, and expectant. Due to its explicit language, you probably should not play it for your children. </p> <p>Feel free to share the link to this page with tired parents and other people who could use a good swear and a laugh.</p>","Academy Award nominee <b>Samuel L.

This was the England of Shakespeare, Jonson, and Bacon; the Gunpowder Plot; the worst outbreak of the plague England had ever seen; arcadian landscapes; murderous, toxic slums; and, above all, sometimes overwhelming religious passion. Jacobean England was both more godly and less godly than it had ever been, and the entire culture was drawn taut between the polarities.</p> <p> This was the world that created the King James Bible. It is the greatest work of English prose ever written, and it is no coincidence that the translation was made at the moment “Englishness” and the English language had come into its first passionate maturity. Boisterous, elegant, subtle, majestic, finely nuanced, sonorous, and musical, the English of Jacobean England has a more encompassing idea of its own reach and scope than any before or since. It is a form of the language that drips with potency and sensitivity. The age, with all its conflicts, explains the book.</p> <p> The sponsor and guide of the whole Bible project was the king himself, the brilliant, ugly, and profoundly peace-loving James the Sixth of Scotland and First of England. Trained almost from birth to manage the rivalries of political factions at home, James saw in England the chance for a sort of irenic Eden over which the new translation of the Bible was to preside. It was to be a Bible for everyone, and as God’s lieutenant on earth, he would use it to unify his kingdom. The dream of Jacobean peace, guaranteed by an elision of royal power and divine glory, lies behind a Bible of extraordinary grace and everlasting literary power.</p> <p> Adam Nicolson is the author of <i>Seamanship, God’s Secretaries</i>, and <i>Seize the Fire</i>. He has won both the Somerset Maugham and William Heinemann awards, and he lives with his family at Sissinghurst Castle in England.</p>","It is the greatest work of English prose ever written, and it is no coincidence that the translation was made at the moment “Englishness” and the English language had come into its first passionate maturity....","08:39:00","4.075117370892019","213","2012-05-30","2015-05-05","Blackstone Audio, Inc.","Biographies & Memoirs:Historical","","God’s Secretaries","","https://www.audible.com/author/Adam+Nicolson/B001IR1OWM","","God’s Secretaries","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61M1NKf7agL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

When he turns his talents to retelling ""Beowulf"", the earliest epic in British literature, the result is a work that combines extensive knowledge with a marvelous strain of pure fun. <p> In Gardner's version of the epic, instead of lauding the helmeted hero, Beowulf, the spotlight shines on Grendel, a beast whose grotesque body and blood thirst condemn him to the life of an outlaw. Grendel is a horrible monster who greedily gobbles up warriors in the Danish mead hall guarded by Beowulf. But within Grendel lurks a soul that delights in dark humor, dramatic pirouettes, and pranks. Both young adult and adult listeners will revel in this powerful complement to a classic tale.</p> <p> George Guidall's narration captures a surreal landscape that shimmers on the other side of the original epic's heroic mirror.

In <i>How Not to Be Wrong</i>, Jordan Ellenberg shows us how terribly limiting this view is: Math isn’t confined to abstract incidents that never occur in real life, but rather touches everything we do—the whole world is shot through with it. </p> <p> Math allows us to see the hidden structures underneath the messy and chaotic surface of our world. It’s a science of not being wrong, hammered out by centuries of hard work and argument. Armed with the tools of mathematics, we can see through to the true meaning of information we take for granted: How early should you get to the airport? What does “public opinion” really represent? Why do tall parents have shorter children? Who really won Florida in 2000? And how likely are you, really, to develop cancer? </p> <p><i>How Not to Be Wrong</i> presents the surprising revelations behind all of these questions and many more, using the mathematician’s method of analyzing life and exposing the hard-won insights of the academic community to the layman—minus the jargon. Ellenberg chases mathematical threads through a vast range of time and space, from the everyday to the cosmic, encountering, among other things, baseball, Reaganomics, daring lottery schemes, Voltaire, the replicability crisis in psychology, Italian Renaissance painting, artificial languages, the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the coming obesity apocalypse, Antonin Scalia’s views on crime and punishment, the psychology of slime molds, what Facebook can and can’t figure out about you, and the existence of God. </p> <p>Ellenberg pulls from history as well as from the latest theoretical developments to provide those not trained in math with the knowledge they need. Math, as Ellenberg says, is “an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.” With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way. <i>How Not to Be Wrong</i> will show you how. </p>","With the tools of mathematics in hand, you can understand the world in a deeper, more meaningful way.

Mr. Hyde is trapped in Dr. Jekyll' s surgical cabinet, counting the days until he will face capture and be forced to make the ultimate choice about survival. Over the course of four days, he thinks back on what brought him to this moment, and he finally has the chance to tell the story of his brief but marvelous life. In liberating Mr. Hyde from the omniscient perspective of the original story, the author takes us inside the mind Hyde shares with Jekyll as he awakens after many years of dormancy, wide-eyed at being able to explore the world on his own. We feel the potions take effect. We tromp through the streets of London, drink gin in seedy pubs, we visit doll shops and menace the men who take advantage of the women there, and we attempt to rescue lost girls. We feel the strange distance of watching Jekyll' s high-class life through a membrane of consciousness. And then we feel the helplessness of someone being framed for serious crimes. The evidence all points to Hyde.

Julian Assange, the editor-in-chief of and visionary behind WikiLeaks, has been a leading voice in the cypherpunk movement since its inception in the 1980s. </p><p>Assange brings together a small group of cutting-edge thinkers and activists from the front line of the battle for cyber-space to discuss whether electronic communications will emancipate or enslave us. Among the topics addressed: Do Facebook and Google constitute ""the greatest surveillance machine that ever existed"", perpetually tracking our location, our contacts and our lives? Far from being victims of that surveillance, are most of us willing collaborators? Are there legitimate forms of surveillance, for instance in relation to the ""Four Horsemen of the Infopocalypse"" (money laundering, drugs, terrorism, and pornography)? And do we have the ability, through conscious action and technological savvy, to resist this tide and secure a world where freedom is something which the Internet helps bring about? </p><p>The harassment of WikiLeaks and other Internet activists, together with attempts to introduce anti-file sharing legislation such as SOPA and ACTA, indicate that the politics of the Internet have reached a crossroads. In one direction lies a future that guarantees, in the watchwords of the cypherpunks, ""privacy for the weak and transparency for the powerful""; in the other lies an Internet that allows government and large corporations to discover ever more about Internet users while hiding their own activities.

But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory. <p>But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr. Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.</p> <p>All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative, the very opposite of Mr. Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr. Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr. Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.</p> <p>Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England.

A captivating history of two men who dramatically changed their contemporaries' view of the past."" (<i>Kirkus</i>) </p> <p>In 1839 rumors of extraordinary yet baffling stone ruins buried within the unmapped jungles of Central America reached two of the world's most intrepid travelers. Seized by the reports, American diplomat John Lloyd Stephens and British artist Frederick Catherwood - each already celebrated for their adventures in Egypt, the Holy Land, Greece, and Rome - sailed together out of New York Harbor on an expedition into the forbidding rainforests of present-day Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico. What they found would rewrite the West's understanding of human history. </p> <p>In the tradition of <i>The Lost City of Z</i> and <i>In the Kingdom of Ice</i>, former <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> journalist and Pulitzer Prize finalist William Carlsen reveals the unforgettable true story of the discovery of the ancient Maya. Enduring disease, war, and the torments of nature and terrain, Stephens and Catherwood uncovered and documented the remains of an astonishing civilization that had flourished in the Americas at the same time as classic Greece and Rome. Their remarkable book about the experience became a sensation and is recognized today as the birth of American archeology. Most importantly, Stephens and Catherwood were the first to grasp the significance of the Maya remains, recognizing that their antiquity and sophistication overturned the West's assumptions about the development of civilization. </p> <p>By the time of the flowering of classical Greece (400 BC), the Maya were already constructing pyramids and temples around central plazas. Within a few hundred years, the structures took on a monumental scale. Over the next millennium dozens of city-states evolved, each governed by powerful lords, some with populations larger than any city in Europe at the time. The Maya developed a unified cosmology, an array of common gods, a creation story, and a shared artistic and architectural vision. They created dazzling stucco and stone monuments and bas reliefs, sculpting figures and hieroglyphs with refined artistic skill. At their peak an estimated 10 million people occupied the Maya's heartland on the Yucatan Peninsula. And yet, by the time the Spanish reached the ""New World"", the classic-era Maya had all but disappeared; they would remain a mystery for the next 300 years. </p> <p>Today the tables are turned: The Maya are justly famous, if sometimes misunderstood, while Stephens and Catherwood have been all but forgotten. Based on Carlsen's rigorous research and his own 2,500-mile journey throughout the Yucatan and Central America, <i>Jungle of Stone</i> is equally a thrilling adventure narrative and a revelatory work of history that corrects our understanding of the Maya and the two remarkable men who set out in 1839 to find them. </p>","In 1839 rumors of extraordinary yet baffling stone ruins buried within the unmapped jungles of Central America reached two of the world's most intrepid travelers....","16:35:00","4.332720588235294","544","2016-04-26","2019-06-24","HarperAudio","Biographies & Memoirs:Adventurers, Explorers & Survival","","Jungle of Stone","","https://www.audible.com/author/William+Carlsen/B076VNF65D","","Jungle of Stone","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xxHgsHNuL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

Perhaps the reason for its enduring appeal is that it is a story filled with qualities close to the human heart: adventure, discovery, desire for immortality, terror, search for the primitive. As Kipling said of Haggard's work, ""It goes, and it grips, and it moves with all the freshness of youth."" <p> Haggard had lived for years among primitive peoples in Africa, and his knowledge of the Dark Continent was matched by few men. Yet beyond his personal knowledge of Africa, his experience of savage life and wild lands, and his ability to make us believe impossible tales, lies a feeling for the supernatural. Adventure alone was not enough for Haggard. As he said, ""The thing must have a heart; mere adventures are not enough: I can turn them out by the peck.""</p> <p> Haggard's novels have been called parables, asking ""What are science, learning, and consciousness of knowledge and power, in the face of omnipotence?"" They have been called romance. And they have been called excitingly alive and imaginative by almost everyone who has ever picked up a volume.</p>","This great novel of African adventure continues to be a favorite among those who love a thrilling tale....","07:34:00","3.875","136","2004-12-30","2010-09-19","Blackstone Audio, Inc.","Literature & Fiction:Classics","","King Solomon's Mines","","","","King Solomon's Mines","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zw24lR5pL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

Dawson","Luke Daniels","<p><b>Go big or go gnome. The </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling authors of </b><b><i>Kill the Farm Boy </i></b><b>welcome you to the world of Pell, the irreverent fantasy universe that recalls Monty Python and Terry Pratchett.</b></p> <p><b>""A complete delight, as fluffy and fun as The Lego Movie and as heartfelt as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone."" (</b><b><i>Locus</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>War is coming, and it’s gonna be Pell.</p> <p>On one side stand the gnomes: smol, cheerful, possessing tidy cardigans and no taste for cruelty.</p> <p>On the other side sit the halflings, proudly astride their war alpacas, carrying bags of grenades and hungry for a fight. And pretty much anything else.</p> <p>It takes only one halfling bomb, and Offi Numminen’s world is turned upside-down - or downside-up, really, since he lives in a hole in the ground. His goth cardigans and aggressive melancholy set him apart from the other gnomes, as does his decision to fight back against their halfling oppressors. Suddenly Offi is the leader of a band of lovable misfits and outcasts - from a gryphon who would literally kill for omelets to a young dwarf herbalist who is better with bees than with his cudgel to an assertive and cheerful teen witch with a beard as long as her book of curses - all on a journey to the Toot Towers to confront the dastardly villain intent on tearing Pell asunder. These adventurers never fit in anywhere else, but as they become friends, fight mermaids, and get really angry at this one raccoon, they learn that there’s nothing more heroic than being yourself.</p> <p>In <i>No Country for Old Gnomes</i>, Delilah S. Dawson and Kevin Hearne lovingly tweak the tropes of fantasy and fairy tales. Here you’ll find goofy jokes and whimsical puns, but you’ll also find a diverse, feminist, and lighthearted approach to fantasy that will bring a smile to your face and many fine cheeses to your plate.</p>","<p>It takes only one halfling bomb, and Offi Numminen’s world is turned upside-down - or downside-up, really, since he lives in a hole in the ground.

Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In <i>Norse Mythology</i>, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin's son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of a giant, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman's deft and witty prose emerge the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again. </p> <p></p>","Neil Gaiman has long been inspired by mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction.

You may not even like him by the time you finish this audiobook, but I promise you will love him by the end of this series. </p> <p>About the heroine: There is a chance that you might think she’s a bit naïve, or weak, but then again who starts out as a badass? </p> <p>Badasses are a product of growth and I am going to put her through hell, and you get to watch her come up swinging every time I knock her on her ass. That’s just how I do things. How she reacts to the set of circumstances she is put through may not be how you, as the listener, or I, as the author, would react to that same situation. Everyone reacts differently to circumstances and how Magdalena responds to her challenges is how I see her as a character and as a person. I don’t write love stories: I write fast-paced, knock you down, make you <i>sit on the edge of your seat wondering what happens next</i> books. If you’re looking for cookie-cutter romance, this isn’t for you. If you can’t handle the ride, unbuckle your seat belt and get out of the roller-coaster car now. If not, you’ve been warned. If nothing outlined above bothers you, carry on and enjoy the ride!</p>","<p>When everything is on the line, how far will you go to protect those you love? What if the cost of saving them is your soul? Would you pay it?

So there's that. But Charley has more on her plate than a mob of testy hellhounds. For one thing, her father has disappeared, and the more she retraces his last steps, the more she learns he was conducting an investigation of his own, one that has Charley questioning everything she's ever known about him.

Mainstream science - as well as religious and cultural institutions - has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages. </p> <p>How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha. While debunking almost everything we ""know"" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book. </p> <p>Ryan and Jetha's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity. </p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO: Includes a Preface written and read by author Christopher Ryan.</b></p>","Since Darwin's day, we've been told that sexual monogamy comes naturally to our species....","10:57:00","4.445526020217147","8013","2010-11-02","2019-12-26","Audible Studios","Health & Wellness:Psychology & Mental Health:Psychology","","Sex at Dawn","","https://www.audible.com/author/Christopher+Ryan/B002V6SRTM","","Sex at Dawn","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uM1IHthhL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

Roach","Kate Reading","<p><i>Six Women of Salem</i> is the first work to use the lives of a select number of representative women as a microcosm to illuminate the larger crisis of the Salem witch trials. By the end of the trials, beyond the 20 who were executed and the five who perished in prison, 207 individuals had been accused, 74 had been ""afflicted"", 32 had officially accused their fellow neighbors, and 255 ordinary people had been inexorably drawn into that ruinous and murderous vortex, and this doesn't include the religious, judicial, and governmental leaders. All this adds up to what the Rev. Cotton Mather called ""a desolation of names"". </p> <p>The individuals involved are too often reduced to stock characters and stereotypes when accuracy is sacrificed to indignation. And although the flood of names and detail in the history of an extraordinary event like the Salem witch trials can swamp the individual lives involved, individuals still deserve to be remembered, and, in remembering specific lives, modern audiences can benefit from such historical intimacy. By examining the lives of six specific women, Marilynne Roach shows listeners what it was like to be present throughout this horrific time and how it was impossible to live through it unchanged.</p>","<i>Six Women of Salem</i> is the first work to use the lives of a select number of representative women as a microcosm to illuminate the larger crisis of the Salem witch trials....","17:08:00","4.069767441860465","129","2014-03-17","2020-03-28","Tantor Audio","History:Americas:United States:Colonial Period","","Six Women of Salem","","https://www.audible.com/author/Marilynne+K.+Roach/B00IMVEWMG","","Six Women of Salem","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mEdPfuNSL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

That's what happened when she made the mistake of revealing her paranormal abilities, bringing her most recent romantic relationship to a hasty end. Her aunt Vella, a gifted but troubled soul, told her years ago to keep her talents a secret. And now that poor Aunt Vella - her last blood relative - has died, Raine has resigned herself to a lonely life. <p>But when she journeys to Shelbyville, Washington, to clear out her aunt's house - trying to ignore the locals' comments about the ""witch"" and the ""crazy lady"" - Raine's highly developed sensitivity leads her to a horrifying discovery: a young woman, bound and terrified, in a basement storage locker. The victim has survived, and the culprit is on the loose. Without warning, a new man enters Raine's life - investigator Zack Jones. Surprisingly, Zack isn't repelled by her powers: in fact, he has his own. While Raine hears voices, Zack sees visions, and within hours of their meeting, Raine experiences an intense, thrilling intimacy - mental, emotional, and physical - that she never dared to expect.</p> <p>There's one complication, however: Zack Jones is working for the Arcane Society. This secret organization, dedicated to the study of paranormal phenomena, shattered Raine's family with an act of betrayal long ago, and she's not about to trust them now. As a killer makes her his target, and a cabal of psychic criminals known as Nightshade operates in the shadows surrounding them, Raine and Zack must rely not only on their powerful abilities but on each other as well.</p>","Being called creepy can be hard on your self-esteem - even for an attractive, independent woman like Raine Tallentyre....","09:36:00","4.400735294117647","544","2008-04-29","2010-09-19","Brilliance Audio","Literature & Fiction:Women's Fiction","","Sizzle and Burn","","https://www.audible.com/author/Jayne+Ann+Krentz/B000APVKX6","","Sizzle and Burn","","https://www.audible.com/series/Arcane-Society-Audiobook/B005NACUWI","Arcane Society","3","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51sVL1df+AL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

But a prophesy has been spoken of a union with the power to set the trolls free, and when Ccile de Troyes is kidnapped and taken beneath the mountain, she learns there is far more to the myth of the trolls than she could have imagined. </p> <p>Ccile has only one thing on her mind after she is brought to Trollus: escape. Only the trolls are clever, fast, and inhumanly strong. She will have to bide her time, wait for the perfect opportunity. But something unexpected happens while she's waiting - she begins to fall for the enigmatic troll prince to whom she has been bonded and married. She begins to make friends. And she begins to see that she may be the only hope for the half-bloods - part troll, part human creatures who are slaves to the full-blooded trolls. There is a rebellion brewing. And her prince, Tristan, the future king, is its secret leader. </p> <p>As Ccile becomes involved in the intricate political games of Trollus, she becomes more than a farmer's daughter. She becomes a princess, the hope of a people, and a witch with magic powerful enough to change Trollus forever.</p>","For five centuries, a witch's curse has bound the trolls to their city beneath the ruins of Forsaken Mountain....","14:30:00","4.373015873015873","1638","2015-02-27","2020-04-13","Audible Studios","Science Fiction & Fantasy:Science Fiction","","Stolen Songbird","","https://www.audible.com/author/Danielle+L.+Jensen/B00FR5FYIG","","Stolen Songbird","","https://www.audible.com/series/The-Malediction-Trilogy-Audiobook/B00VFAI4BQ","The Malediction Trilogy","1","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WhQAiF1bL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

To the strikingly gorgeous man, loyalty and honor mean everything. So it's no surprise that he's determined to treat Isi Rousseau as the enemy. If the elders believe she is a danger then he will do whatever necessary to prevent her from destroying his beloved Wildlands. But discovering the delicate beauty sleeping in his bed, Talon discovers his noble intentions wavering. The female, with short, jet black hair streaked with blue, and a pair of dark eyes, might act tough, but it's obvious to him that she's as desperate as he is for a place to call home. More importantly, her presence is helping keep Ashe and her baby alive. Suddenly things are not quite as black and white as Talon assumed, and he must decide if his loyalty to his people is worth losing his true mate. </p> <p>XavierHe shouldn't want his best friend's little sister… The drop-dead gorgeous leader of the Geeks, Xavier has one goal: Find the human male his enemies seek. Devoted to his work, and to the Pantera, there is nothing that can distract him from accomplishing his goal. Until he spots his best friend's little sister alone and partying it up with a bunch of human males at the local bar. Consumed with possessiveness, Xavier takes her home and refuses to leave her side until her brother returns. He tries to convince himself he's just looking out for her, but the longer he's around Amalie, the harder it is to deny the molten attraction that burns between them. She has three days to change his mind… Beautiful and strong-willed Hunter, Amalie is free. No brother to tell her what to do, and no Pantera watching over her because she happens to be the last Pantera born. But before she can truly enjoy herself, her brother's best friend tries to put her on lockdown. Xavier has been the star in all of Mal's fantasies, and there's no one she'd rather give her virginity to. But the sexy male refuses to open his eyes and see what's right in front of him. Mal knows she has three days to change his mind. Three days to make him see her as grown, and the one female he can't resist. </p>","After the tragic death of his parents when Talon was young, he's dedicated his life to protecting the Pantera....","04:57:00","4.376237623762377","101","2013-12-19","2014-02-01","Laura E.

She conjures up early operating theaters - no place for the squeamish - and surgeons, working before anesthesia, who were lauded for their speed and brute strength. These medical pioneers knew that the aftermath of surgery was often more dangerous than their patients' afflictions, and they were baffled by the persistent infections that kept mortality rates stubbornly high. At a time when surgery couldn't have been more hazardous, an unlikely figure stepped forward: a young, melancholy Quaker surgeon named Joseph Lister, who would solve the deadly riddle and change the course of history. </p> <p>Fitzharris dramatically recounts Lister's discoveries in gripping detail, culminating in his audacious claim that germs were the source of all infection - and could be countered by antiseptics. Focusing on the tumultuous period from 1850 to 1875, she introduces us to Lister and his contemporaries - some of them brilliant, some outright criminal - and takes us through the grimy medical schools and dreary hospitals where they learned their art, the deadhouses where they studied anatomy, and the graveyards they occasionally ransacked for cadavers. </p> <p>Eerie and illuminating, <i>The Butchering Art </i>celebrates the triumph of a visionary surgeon whose quest to unite science and medicine delivered us into the modern world. </p>","In The Butchering Art, the historian Lindsey Fitzharris reveals the shocking world of 19th-century surgery on the eve of profound transformation....","07:54:00","4.594733242134063","2924","2017-10-31","2019-05-12","Audible Studios","Biographies & Memoirs:Professionals & Academics:Medical","","The Butchering Art","","https://www.audible.com/author/Lindsey+Fitzharris/B06VWMDL4M","","The Butchering Art","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51R-bzs61nL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

These brilliant, ambitious, curious men believed in angels, alchemy, and the devil, and they also believed that the universe followed precise, mathematical laws, a contradiction that tormented them and changed the course of history. <i>The Clockwork Universe</i> is the fascinating and compelling story of the bewildered geniuses of the Royal Society, the men who made the modern world.</p>","<i>The Clockwork Universe</i> is the story of a band of men who lived in a world of dirt and disease but pictured a universe that ran like a perfect machine....","10:04:00","4.207407407407407","3780","2011-02-08","2016-05-16","Audible Studios","Biographies & Memoirs:Professionals & Academics:Science & Technology","","The Clockwork Universe","","https://www.audible.com/author/Edward+Dolnick/B001HD0WFM","","The Clockwork Universe","","","","","","false","english","","https://d2fahduf2624mg.cloudfront.net/pre_purchase_docs/BK_ADBL_002991/2020-06-22-07-25-27/bk_adbl_002991.pdf","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61u-4YMFxUL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

It has no place in a serious academic publication, and Karswell is a half-bright fool. However, when the editor writes a rejection note to Karswell, he inadvertently includes her entire email. Occultist Karswell (Reece Shearsmith) doesn’t take kindly to criticism.   </p> <p>On the tube home with her partner Edward Dunning (Tom Burke), Jo spots a poster with her name on it. It reads: 'In memory of Joanne Harrington, M.Litt, PhD, died September eighteenth, three days were allowed.' Is there anything that Edward can do to save Jo from this curse? </p> <p><i>Lost Hearts</i> - adapted by A. K. Benedict</p> <p>Teenager Stephanie Elliot (Rosa Coduri) is taken to Aswarby House to be fostered by Mrs Bunch (Susan Jameson). Stephanie strikes up a friendship with Ben (Bill Milner), the adopted son of charismatic community leader Mr Abney (Jeff Rawle). He tells her that Mr Abney is a good man: he even took in a child refugee last year, but she ran away and stole from him. Stephanie is troubled by voices and visions of a dead girl clutching at her chest, and when Ben disappears she begins to suspect that all is not right in Aswarby House.</p> <p><i>The Treasure of Abbot-Thomas</i> - adapted by Jonathan Barnes</p> <p>When former Somerton school pupil Greg Parsbury (Robert Bathurst) meets history teacher Mika Chantry (Pearl Mackie) at a memorial service for schoolmaster Sam Abbot-Thomas, he begs for her help. He has been sent a postcard by the estate of the mysterious and charismatic Abbot-Thomas. On it is a strange inscription in Latin, which he believes to be an inaugural clue in a treasure hunt: much like the elaborate treasure hunts Abbot-Thomas used to set back in the 1970s. There were rumours that Abbot-Thomas possessed a hidden fortune, and Parsbury and Chantry set out to find it.</p> <p><i>A View from a Hill </i>- adapted by Mark Morris</p> <p>Comedian and podcaster Paul Fanshawe (Andy Nyman) and his wife, Sarah (Alice Lowe), visit the Cotswolds on holiday, trying to rebuild their lives after the death of their young son, Archie. Whilst out walking they spot a beautiful abbey across the valley on Gallows Hill, but when they reach it, they find the building is little more than rubble. While Sarah explores, Paul records commentary for his podcast. Sarah thinks she hears children’s laughter, but there’s no-one there. Later that night she listens back to the recording and hears a child’s voice whisper, 'Mummy.' Sarah is convinced that Archie is trying to reach them and wants to return to the ruins.

Or did her accusers create a violent fiction in order to remove this beautiful, intelligent, ambitious foe from the male-dominated world of Hungarian politics? </p> <p>In 1611 Countess Erzsébet Báthory, a powerful Hungarian noblewoman, stood helpless as masons walled her inside her castle tower, dooming her to spend her final years in solitary confinement. Her crime: the gruesome murders of dozens of female servants, mostly young girls tortured to death for displeasing their ruthless mistress. Her opponents painted her as a bloodthirsty škrata - a witch - a portrayal that would expand to grotesque proportions through the centuries. </p> <p>In this riveting dramatization of Erzsébet Báthory's life, the countess tells her story in her own words, writing to her only son - a final reckoning from his mother in an attempt to reveal the truth behind her downfall. Countess Báthory describes her upbringing in one of the most powerful noble houses in Hungary, recounting in loving detail her devotion to her parents and siblings as well as the heartbreak of losing her father at a young age. She soon discovers the price of being a woman in 16th-century Hungary as her mother arranges her marriage to Ferenc Nádasdy, a union made with the cold calculation of a financial transaction. Young Erzsébet knows she has no choice but to accept this marriage even as she laments its loveless nature and ultimately turns to the illicit affections of another man. </p> <p>Seemingly resigned to a marriage of convenience and a life of surreptitious pleasure, the countess surprises even herself as she ignites a marital spark with Ferenc through the most unromantic of acts: the violent punishment of an insolent female servant. The event shows Ferenc that his wife is no trophy but rather a strong, determined woman more than capable of managing their vast estates during Ferenc's extensive military campaigns against the Turks. Her naked assertion of power accomplishes what her famed beauty could not: capturing the love of her husband.</p> <p>The countess embraces this new role of loving wife and mother, doing everything she can to expand her husband's power and secure her family's future. But a darker side surfaces as Countess Báthory's demand for virtue, obedience, and, above all, respect from her servants takes a sinister turn. What emerges is not only a disturbing, unflinching portrait of the deeds that gave Báthory the moniker ""Blood Countess"", but an intimate look at the woman who became a monster. </p>","Was the ""Blood Countess"" history's first - and perhaps worst - female serial killer?

Yet the town had denied all early signs of the radical evil that was growing within Corwin. What had led the local media to ignore his early rapes?

Bray","<p><b>2017 Audie Award Finalist </b></p> <p>After a bizarre and disturbing incident at the funeral of matriarch Marian Savage, the McCray and Savage families look forward to a restful and relaxing summer at Beldame, on Alabama's Gulf Coast, where three Victorian houses loom over the shimmering beach. Two of the houses are habitable, while the third is slowly and mysteriously being buried beneath an enormous dune of blindingly white sand. But though long uninhabited, the third house is not empty. Inside, something deadly lies in wait. Something that has terrified Dauphin Savage and Luker McCray since they were boys and which still haunts their nightmares. Something horrific that may be responsible for several terrible and unexplained deaths years earlier - and is now ready to kill again.... </p> <p>A haunted house story unlike any other, Michael McDowell's <i>The Elementals</i> (1981) was one of the finest novels to come out of the horror publishing explosion of the 1970s and '80s. Though best known for his screenplays for Tim Burton's <i>Beetlejuice</i> and <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i>, McDowell is now being rediscovered as one of the best modern horror writers and a master of Southern Gothic literature. This edition of McDowell's masterpiece of terror features a new introduction by award-winning horror author Michael Rowe. McDowell's first novel, the grisly and darkly comic <i>The Amulet</i> (1979), is also available from Valancourt Books.</p>","After a bizarre and disturbing incident at the funeral of matriarch Marian Savage, the McCray and Savage families look forward to a restful and relaxing summer at Beldame....","08:06:00","4.276495132127955","7190","2016-06-24","2020-06-20","Valancourt Books","Literature & Fiction:Horror:Gothic","","The Elementals","","https://www.audible.com/author/Michael+McDowell/B0034O660W","","The Elementals","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BZfFXS-ZL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

But she will also find two allies: Cardinal Chang, a brutal assassin with the heart of a poet, and a royal doctor named Svenson, at once fumbling and heroic; both of whom, like her, lost someone at Harschmort Manor.

His unique blend of rigorous research and engaging storytelling invites us into the lives and minds of remarkable scientists who have helped unravel the unexpected fabric of reality with reasoning rather than superstition and dogma, and to explain how everything we see - and can’t see - came about. A passionate advocate for reason, Krauss gives the rationale for the seemingly irrational - and the mysteries and apparent contradictions of quantum physics, and explores what that means for our lives here on Earth - and beyond.</p> <p>At its core, <i>The Greatest Story Ever Told - So Far</i> is about the best of what it means to be human - an epic history of our ultimately purposeless universe that addresses the question, “Why are we here?”</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>","<p>In this grand poetic vision of the universe, Lawrence Krauss tells the dramatic story of the discovery of the hidden world that underlies reality - and our place within it.

Countless hours were spent on the hunt for the elusive orb, and some of the era's most skilled astronomers even claimed to have found it. </p><p>There was just one problem: It was never there. </p><p>In <i>The Hunt for Vulcan</i>, Thomas Levenson follows the visionary scientists who inhabit the story of the phantom planet, starting with Isaac Newton, who, in 1687, provided an explanation for all matter in motion throughout the universe, leading to Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier, who, almost two centuries later, built on Newton's theories and discovered Neptune, becoming the most famous scientist in the world. Le Verrier attempted to surpass that triumph by predicting the existence of yet another planet in our solar system: Vulcan. </p><p>It took Albert Einstein to discern that the mystery of the missing planet was a problem not of measurements or math but of Newton's theory of gravity itself. Einstein's general theory of relativity proved that Vulcan did not and could not exist and that the search for it had merely been a quirk of operating under the wrong set of assumptions about the universe. Levenson tells the previously untold tale of how the ""discovery"" of Vulcan in the 19th century set the stage for Einstein's monumental breakthrough, the greatest individual intellectual achievement of the 20th century. </p><p>A dramatic human story of an epic quest, <i>The Hunt for Vulcan</i> offers insight into how science really advances (as opposed to the way we're taught about it in school) and how the best work of the greatest scientists reveals an artist's sensibility. Opening a new window onto our world, Levenson illuminates some of our most iconic ideas as he recounts one of the strangest episodes in the history of science. </p>","For more than 50 years, the world's top scientists searched for the ""missing"" planet Vulcan, whose existence was mandated by Isaac Newton's theories of gravity....","05:49:00","4.287518573551263","1346","2015-11-03","2016-08-31","Audible Studios","Science & Engineering:Science:Astronomy & Space Science:Astronomy","","The Hunt for Vulcan","","https://www.audible.com/author/Thomas+Levenson/B001HCU6CW","","The Hunt for Vulcan","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DjnQqKp0L._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

"BK_ADOP_100020","B01GEPQFEY","https://www.audible.com/pd/B01GEPQFEY","The Oedipus Plays - An Audible Original Drama","Sophocles, Ian Johnston - translator","Jamie Glover, Hayley Atwell, Michael Maloney, Samantha Bond, Julian Glover, David Horovitch","<p>The three Theban plays by Sophocles - <i>Oedipus the King</i>, <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i> and <i>Antigone</i> - are one of the great landmarks of Western theatre. They tell the story of Oedipus, King of Thebes, who was destined to suffer a terrible fate - to kill his father, marry his mother, and beget children of the incestuous union. He does this unknowingly but still has to suffer terrible consequences, which also tragically affect the next generation. </p> 
<p>These three plays were written around 450 BC, with the playwright following the established convention of presenting the story through main characters but using a chorus - sometimes one voice, sometimes more - as an independent commentator that also occasionally participates in the drama. When the audiences of ancient Athens went to the amphitheatres to see the plays, they would have known the basic story of poor Oedipus. </p> 
<p>Nevertheless, the power of Sophocles' retelling made the Theban plays deeply horrifying and affecting - and this is still true now, some 2,500 years later. There is also a strong contemporary resonance for us, for in the 20th century the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud famously adopted the story to illustrate his Oedipus complex, which, he argued, was a condition of the unconscious mind in boys - that they want to sleep with their mothers. It is interesting that through the character of the queen, Jocasta, in <i>Oedipus the King</i>, Sophocles states this unequivocally. </p> 
<p><i>Oedipus the King</i> is well known. The other two are less so: <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>, which deals with his last days, and <i>Antigone</i>, which casts the spotlight on his daughter, who, as part of the accursed blood line, chooses to act in a way she believes is right, whatever the consequences. Yet they are equally powerful and moving. </p> 
<p>This audio production, with Jamie Glover as Oedipus and Hayley Atwell as his daughter, Antigone, is a world premiere audio recording of all three plays. </p> 
<p>With the authoritative but modern translation by Ian Johnston, specially commissioned new music from the English composer Roger Marsh, and a cast of outstanding actors, this Audible Original presentation of Sophocles' Theban plays will be listened to not once but many times. </p>","The three Theban plays by Sophocles - Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone - are one of the great landmarks of Western theatre....","05:05:00","4.3692493946731235","826","2016-06-14","2017-05-28","Audible Studios","Literature & Fiction:Ancient, Classical & Medieval Literature:Drama","","The Oedipus Plays","","https://www.audible.com/author/Sophocles/B01AS32LBY","","The Oedipus Plays","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pjYyo5NlL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

This dandy, who remains forever unchanged---petulant, hedonistic, vain, and amoral---while a painting of him ages and grows increasingly hideous with the years, has been horrifying and enchanting readers for more than 100 years. Taking the reader in and out of London drawing rooms, to the heights of aestheticism, and to the depths of decadence, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is not simply a melodrama about moral corruption. Laced with bon mots and vivid depictions of upper-class refinement, it is also a fascinating look at the milieu of Wilde's fin-de-siècle world and a manifesto of the creed ""Art for Art's Sake.""The ever-quotable Wilde, who once delighted London with his scintillating plays, scandalized readers with this, his only novel. Upon publication, Dorian was condemned as dangerous, poisonous, stupid, vulgar, and immoral, and Wilde as a ""driveling pedant."" The novel, in fact, was used against Wilde at his much-publicized trials for ""gross indecency,"" which led to his imprisonment and exile on the European continent. Even so, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> firmly established Wilde as one of the great voices of the Aesthetic movement and endures as a classic that is as timeless as its hero.","The dreamlike story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty....","08:06:00","4.101342572542226","2309","2008-09-12","2014-11-27","Tantor Audio","Literature & Fiction:Classics","","The Picture of Dorian Gray","","https://www.audible.com/author/Oscar+Wilde/B000AQ0DXI","","The Picture of Dorian Gray","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51HpqAS235L._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

For centuries, royal families have feared the gut-roiling, vomit-inducing agony of a little something added to their food or wine by an enemy. To avoid poison, they depended on tasters, unicorn horns, and antidotes tested on condemned prisoners. Servants licked the royal family's spoons, tried on their underpants, and tested their chamber pots.</p> <p>Ironically, royals terrified of poison were unknowingly poisoning themselves daily with their cosmetics, medications, and filthy living conditions. Women wore makeup made with mercury and lead. Men rubbed turds on their bald spots. Physicians prescribed mercury enemas, arsenic skin cream, drinks of lead filings, and potions of human fat and skull, fresh from the executioner. The most gorgeous palaces were little better than filthy latrines.

It is for mature audiences only. Just like the original graphic novels, this audio adaptation contains explicit language and graphic violence, as well as strong sexual content and themes. Discretion is advised. </b></p> <p>Hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i> as “the greatest epic in the history of comic books”, <i>The Sandman </i>changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (<i>It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split</i>) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman</i> originally re-defined the graphic novel. </p> <p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three “tools” that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more. </p> <p>A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you’ve never heard anything like this.</p>","<p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping....</p>","11:02:00","4.646084409660537","41654","2020-07-15","2020-07-20","Audible Originals","Science Fiction & Fantasy:Fantasy","","The Sandman","","https://www.audible.com/author/Neil+Gaiman/B000AQ01G2","","The Sandman","","https://www.audible.com/series/The-Sandman-Audiobook/B09BDHZ4F9","The Sandman","1","","","english","","https://d2fahduf2624mg.cloudfront.net/post_purchase_docs/OR_ORIG_000747/2020-10-07-05-10-32/or_orig_000747.pdf","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CEI+8TpdL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

While not every story is concerned with the hard science behind space travel and other futuristic ventures, fiction can give us amazing insight into what we could be capable of and what we dream of doing. </p> <p>In the 10 lectures of <i>The Science of Sci-Fi: From Warp Speed to Interstellar Travel</i>, Professor Erin Macdonald interweaves real science and the achievements of the imagination to reveal the truth that underlies our favorite stories and sheds light on what the future may hold. From faster-than-light travel to journeys through time itself, science fiction makes humanity seem limitless. So, what scientific boundaries are we pushing against as we seek to fly among the stars? </p> <p>Beginning with an overview of the physics of time and space as we know them, Professor Macdonald shows how stories extrapolate current knowledge to create visions of the future and how likely - or unlikely - these fictional journeys could be. What would happen if a spaceship flew into a wormhole, as it does in the film <i>Galaxy Quest</i>? Or, if you prefer video games, what would happen if you fired a rocket launcher on the Moon like the soldiers of <i>Mass Effect</i>?

How could the ancient people who inhabited this tiny speck of land, the most remote in the vast expanse of the Pacific islands, have built such monumental works? </p> <p>No such astonishing numbers of massive statues are found anywhere else in the Pacific. How could the islanders possibly have moved so many multi-ton monoliths from the quarry inland, where they were carved, to their posts along the coastline? And most intriguing and vexing of all, if the island once boasted a culture developed and sophisticated enough to have produced such marvelous edifices, what happened to that culture? Why was the island the Europeans encountered a sparsely populated wasteland? </p> <p>The prevailing accounts of the island’s history tell a story of self-inflicted devastation: a glaring case of eco-suicide. The island was dominated by a powerful chiefdom that promulgated a cult of statue making, exercising a ruthless hold on the island’s people and rapaciously destroying the environment, cutting down a lush palm forest that once blanketed the island in order to construct contraptions for moving more and more statues, which grew larger and larger. As the population swelled in order to sustain the statue cult, growing well beyond the island’s agricultural capacity, a vicious cycle of warfare broke out between opposing groups, and the culture ultimately suffered a dramatic collapse. </p> <p>When Terry Hunt and Carl Lipo began carrying out archaeological studies on the island in 2001, they fully expected to find evidence supporting these accounts. Instead, revelation after revelation uncovered a very different truth.</p>","The monumental statues of Easter Island have been the source of great mystery ever since the island was first discovered in 1722....","06:36:00","3.8237986270022883","437","2011-10-18","2013-12-11","Audible Studios","History:Australia, New Zealand & Oceania","","The Statues That Walked","","","","The Statues That Walked","","","","","","false","english","","https://d2fahduf2624mg.cloudfront.net/pre_purchase_docs/BK_ADBL_003341/2020-06-22-08-50-26/bk_adbl_003341.pdf","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510ByBEWLDL._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

The crime horrified all of England and led to a national obsession with detection - ironically destroying, in the process, the career of perhaps the greatest detective in the land. <p>At the time, the detective was a relatively new invention; there were only eight detectives in all of England and rarely were they called out of London, but this crime was so shocking that Scotland Yard sent its best man to investigate, Inspector Jonathan Whicher.</p> <p>Whicher quickly believed the unbelievable - that someone within the family was responsible for the murder of young Saville Kent. Without sufficient evidence or a confession, though, his case was circumstantial and he returned to London a broken man. Though he would be vindicated five years later, the real legacy of Jonathan Whicher lives on in fiction: the tough, quirky, knowing, and all-seeing detective that we know and love today - from the cryptic Sergeant Cuff in Wilkie Collins's <i>The Moonstone </i> to Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade. </p> <p><i>The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher </i>is a provocative work of nonfiction that reads like a Victorian thriller, and in it author Kate Summerscale has fashioned a brilliant, multilayered narrative that is as cleverly constructed as it is beautifully written.</p>","In June of 1860 three-year-old Saville Kent was found at the bottom of an outdoor privy with his throat slit.

In many cases their survival was miraculous, if puzzling. Observers were amazed by the transformations that took place when different parts of the brain were destroyed, altering victims' personalities. Parents suddenly couldn't recognize their own children. Pillars of the community became pathological liars. Some people couldn't speak but could still sing. </p> <p>In <i>The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons</i>, Sam Kean travels through time with stories of neurological curiosities: Phantom limbs, Siamese twin brains, viruses that eat patients' memories, blind people who see through their tongues. He weaves these narratives together to create a story of discovery that reaches back to the 1500s and the high-profile jousting accident that inspired this book's title.* With the lucid, masterful explanations and razor-sharp wit his fans have come to expect, Kean explores the brain's secret passageways and recounts the forgotten tales of the ordinary people whose struggles, resilience, and deep humanity made neuroscience possible. </p> <p>*""The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons"" refers to the case of French king Henri II, who in 1559 was lanced through the skull during a joust, resulting in one of the most significant cases in neuroscience history.

Taking in 440 sextillion kilometers of space and 13.8 billion years of time, it is physically impossible to make a better map: We will never see the early universe in more detail. On the one hand, such a view is the apotheosis of modern cosmology; on the other, it threatens to undermine almost everything we hold cosmologically sacrosanct. The map contains anomalies that challenge our understanding of the universe. It will force us to revisit what is known and what is unknown, to construct a new model of our universe. </p> <p>This is the first book to address what will be an epoch-defining scientific paradigm shift. Stuart Clark will ask if Newton's famous laws of gravity need to be rewritten, if dark matter and dark energy are just celestial phantoms. Can we ever know what happened before the big bang? What's at the bottom of a black hole? Are there universes beyond our own? Does time exist? Are the once immutable laws of physics changing? </p>","A groundbreaking guide to the universe and how our latest deep-space discoveries are forcing us to revisit what we know - and what we don't....","08:22:00","4.361136571952337","1091","2016-09-06","2017-03-09","Audible Studios","Science & Engineering:Science:Astronomy & Space Science:Astronomy","","The Unknown Universe","","https://www.audible.com/author/Stuart+Clark/B001HP3TZA","","The Unknown Universe","","","","","","false","english","","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gwmiZGb7L._SL500_.jpg","","US","","","false"

We're witches, and we're hunting you.</b></p> <p>From the moment powerful men started falling to the #MeToo movement, the lamentations began: This is feminism gone too far, this is injustice, this is a witch hunt. In <i>The Witches Are Coming</i>, firebrand author of the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling memoir and now critically acclaimed Hulu TV series <i>Shrill </i>Lindy West turns that refrain on its head. You think this is a witch hunt? Fine. You've got one.</p> <p>In a laugh-out-loud, incisive cultural critique, West extolls the world-changing magic of truth, urging listeners to reckon with dark lies in the heart of the American mythos, and unpacking the complicated, and sometimes tragic, politics of not being a white man in the 21st century. She tracks the misogyny and propaganda hidden (or not so hidden) in the media she and her peers devoured growing up, a buffet of distortions, delusions, prejudice, and outright bullsh*t that has allowed white male mediocrity to maintain a death grip on American culture and politics-and that delivered us to this precarious, disorienting moment in history.</p> <p>West writes, ""We were just a hair's breadth from electing America's first female president to succeed America's first black president. We weren't done, but we were doing it. And then, true to form-like the Balrog's whip catching Gandalf by his little gray bootie, like the husband in a Lifetime movie hissing, 'If I can't have you, no one can' - white American voters shoved an incompetent, racist con man into the White House.""</p> <p>We cannot understand how we got here - how the land of the free became Trump's America - without examining the chasm between who we are and who we think we are, without fact-checking the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and each other.

Though revered, Paul has also been controversial. Apocryphal writings by Peter and James charge Paul with being a tool of Satan. In later centuries, Paul was scorned by such writers as Thomas Jefferson, George Bernard Shaw, and Nietzsche.<p> In this masterly analysis, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Garry Wills chronicles Paul's tremendous influence on the first explosion of Christian belief, the controversy surrounding Paul through the centuries, and the meaning of his words. He argues eloquently that what Paul meant was not contrary to what Jesus meant. Rather, the best way to know Jesus is to discover Paul. Unlike the Gospel writers, who carefully shaped their narratives many decades after Jesus' life, Paul wrote in the heat of the moment, offering the best reflection of those early times.</p>","Throughout history, Christians have debated Paul's influence in the church.

They were alternately known as ""waste people"", ""offals"", ""rubbish"", ""lazy lubbers"", and ""crackers"". By the 1850s the downtrodden included so-called ""clay eaters"" and ""sandhillers"", known for prematurely aged children distinguished by their yellowish skin, ragged clothing, and listless minds. </p> <p>In <i>White Trash</i>, Nancy Isenberg upends assumptions about America's supposedly class-free society. Poor whites were central to the rise of the Republican Party in the early 19th century, and the Civil War itself was fought over class issues nearly as much as it was fought over slavery.

Zero - infinity's twin - is not like other numbers. It is both nothing and everything. For centuries the power of zero smacked of the demonic; once harnessed, it became the most important tool in mathematics. In <i>Zero</i>, science journalist Charles Seife follows this innocent-looking number from its birth as an Eastern philosophical concept to its struggle for acceptance in Europe, its rise and transcendence in the West, and its ever-present threat to modern physics. Here are the legendary thinkers - from Pythagoras to Newton to Heisenberg, from the Kabalists to today's astrophysicists - who have tried to understand it and whose clashes shook the foundations of philosophy, science, mathematics, and religion.","The Babylonians invented it, the Greeks banned it, the Hindus worshipped it, and the Church used it to ward off heretics.
